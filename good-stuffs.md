## Programming



["A Little Architecture"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html) by Uncle Bob Martin

> The important decisions that a Software Architect makes are the ones that allow you to **NOT** make the decisions about the database, and the webserver, and the frameworks.

["Three Paradigms"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/12/19/Three-Paradigms.html) by Uncle Bob Martin



["Respecting Levels of Abstraction"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2017/01/27/respecting-abstraction/) by Jonathan Boccara

>A given level of abstraction is characterized by **what** is done in it. 
<br /><br />
>When we move from a higher level of abstraction to a lower one, the execution of the tasks in the less abstract level is **how** we implement the more abstract level.

> I deem respecting the levels of abstraction to be the most important principle in programming, because it automatically implies many other best practices.
<br /><br />
If you think about this principle when designing your code and constantly ask yourself the question, **“In terms of what am I coding here?”**, your code will flow naturally, perform its function well, and be a pleasure to use for the other programmers and developers who have to work with it.
<br /><br />
By identifying what things the code does and replacing each one with a label, we know how to raise levels of abstraction in order to make code more expressive.

["The Right Attitude to Deal with Legacy Code"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2017/03/01/deal-with-legacy-code/) by Jonathan Boccara

> ... **consider that the code you’re working on is your code**. Even if you haven’t written it yourself, and regardless of how good or bad you think it is, this is your code, and you have responsibility over it.

[Don’t Get Obsessed With Design Patterns](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2016/06/15/dont-get-obsessed-design-patterns/) by Joel Rodriguez

> I believe that knowing object-oriented design principles and applying best practices like SOLID, KISS and YAGNI are far more important than design patterns themselves. If you apply these principles, **patterns will come out naturally**.



["Don’t Overwhelm Yourself Trying to Learn Too Much"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2014/06/23/dont-overwhelm-trying-learn-much/) by John Sonmez

> I think the best way to improve your skills and to learn what you need to do is to do the learning as close to the time you need the information as possible –- **just-in-time learning**.




["Staying relevant as a programmer"](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43) by Mattias Petter Johansson or MPJ

> Are we forever cursed to do this constant tooling rodeo, where we try to hold on in the job market for dear life, learning new tools as the plop up all over the place?
<br /><br />
Instead of trying to predict the future, which we humans are really bad at — just look at sci-fi movies from the 60-ies — **you should learn the stuff that doesn’t change around a lot**.
<br /><br />
Learn the fundamentals that we figured out in the 70s and that have been true since. Learn programming in *general*. Don’t be better Angular programmer, or even a better JavaScript programmer — just be a better programmer, period.

[Another appetizer for the upcoming big music question](https://greghowlett.com/blog/music-philosophy/appetizer.aspx?affid=5114) by Greg Howlett
- This is one of Greg's articles (among others) that changed my view on "music standards". (I had a very strict standard before :blush:)
