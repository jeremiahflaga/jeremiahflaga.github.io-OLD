Good day Sir/Ma'am,

I am Jeremiah M. Flaga, a software developer for about five years already.

I experienced being involved in ASP.NET projects for about four years and in an Android project for about a year.

But I believe I can be able to work on any project that use _any_ technology stack, most especially when the original designers and current designers of the software project structured their software so that it can be _easily_ understood by others.

If you have a team that uses [TDD](/tdd-quotes/) as one of their practices, I would like to request you to please let me be involved in that team :smile: (even if the team is _not_ using technologies I am specifically familiar with). If the project is small or medium in size, I believe I can be able to contribute after about a month of familiarizing myself with the technology stack being used in that project (with the help of my teammates, of course :smile:).

I prefer to be involved in a team that uses [TDD](/tdd-quotes/) because I believe that, _today,_ if a team uses TDD as part of their practices, it is a very good indication that the members of that team cares _so much_ about their work, and about their teammates (and, of course, their clients).

_(I'm not saying that those who do not practice TDD do not care. I'm just saying that those who practice TDD cares 'more'.)_

If you do not have a team that uses TDD, I would like to be involved in a team that has code reviews (and/or pair programming) as part of their practices. I want to be involved in that kind of team because, I believe, if a team practices code reviews (and/or pair programming), it indicates that that team cares _so much_ about their work, and their teammates (and, of course, their clients).

_(I'm not saying that those who do not practice code reviews and/or pair programming do not care. I'm just saying that those who practice them cares 'more'.)_

Thank you so much for your time. :smile:
