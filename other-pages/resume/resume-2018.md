## **I'm an initiate**

Using [Terence McGhee's "Software Ninja Class Hierarchy"](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2015/10/25/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html), today, I consider myself to be an **_Initiate_**, because I <em>try</em> to write code that is easy to read. I do that because I know that programmers spend more time reading code that writing code. I'm not saying that I _always_ write code that is easy to read (I still write messy code during _trying_ times or during _boring_ times or _lazy_ times), but I'm already aware, through experience, that code that is easy to read is valuable code.

But I think you can still forgive me if I consider myself a **_Level Zero Codesmith_** (Please note that in programming, _"zero"_ has meaning other than _"none"_ :grin:) because I have little knowledge about TDD, the SOLID principles, Clean/Decoupled Architecture, and some Design Patterns .

          This is where I was first exposed to DDD. Our employer made us study DDD because we will be using it in an in-house project. But I was not lucky to be involved in the in-house project because the employement of three junior developers, which inlcuded me, stopped after six months due to some problems unbeknownst to me.
          <br /><br />
          I just saw the initial structure of the project. I saw that there was a <code>Core</code> module, which I now understand to be the module which holds the business rules. There was also an <code>Infrastructure</code> module(s), which holds the data layer and some other parts of the system. There was no presentation layer yet during the time that I saw the project.

        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          <ol>
            <li> 
              I learned more about what Object-Oriented programming is. (When I applied for this job, I claimed that I knew OOP. But I )
            </li>
            <br />
            <li> 
              I learned that programmers at this level of their carreer needs lots of guidance/mentoring from their seniors (most especially when the project is in a complex state already, and if the seniors don't want the juniors to mess with the project :grin:).
              <br /><br />
              When I become a senior developer someday, I intend to guide/mentor my teammates who are in the beginning years of their carreer (provided of course that they also share some of their knowledge with me. :smile:)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              This is the time where I, and my teammates, plunged into the Clean Code book because one of our team leads made us read one chapter of the book each week, and spend about an hour each week discussing that chapter.
              <br /><br />
              Unfortunately, for some reasons unknown to me, our discussions stopped after a few meetings. We did not finish the book. We only discussed up to chapter five, I think. And I read up to chapter 8 of the book only. :disappointed:
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              This is where I experienced writing unit tests <em>after-the-fact</em>, that is, after the production code is already written.
              <br /><br />
              There were parts of the system that were somewhat easy to test. But there were parts that were hard to test. Those parts that were hard to tests? — those that used DateTime.Now, and static methods, and extension methods of C# (which basically are still static methods), those parts that use (what I now know as) Service Locator — I skipped testing them :smiling_imp:. Of course I first tried to look for ways on how to test those things... I remember even trying to read "The Art of Unit Testing" to help myself with the task (I did not finish the book of course. I read only the first few chapters. :grin:)
              <br /><br />
              I think the time I spent writing those tests was a waste of time, partly because there were parts of the system that I skipped testing (because I did not know how to test them), and partly because I did not have the goal of using the tests to make the design of the system better. (During that time I do not yet know that books such as <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Working-Effectively-with-Legacy-Code-Michael-Feathers/9780131177055">"Working Effectively with Legacy Code"</a> exists.)
              <br /><br />
              Don't get me wrong here. I don't hate unit testing. During that time I already have a great appreciation on the benefits of having unit tests — it's been three years already since I first heard about unit testing and TDD.
              <br /><br />
              But I think I should have told my team leads about my opinion that writing those tests was just a waste of time. If I told them about it, they might have explained to me why those tests should be written, and they might have helped me look for ways to write tests for the <em>untestables</em>. But I was very timid during that time and was afraid to express my opinions.
              <br /><br />
              But despite that experience, I'm not against writing tests. I am even a <a href="/quotes/tdd-quotes/">TDD advocate</a> today through the influence of Uncle Bob Martin. But writing tests after the production code is already written requires a somewhat different skillset than doing TDD. I was, and is still, not skillfull on writing tests <em>after-the-fact</em>. But I'm trying to be good at it also.

        rather it is kind of the turning point of my midset. I was very frameworks-oriented since I started learning about creating line-of-business applications.

          <br /><br />
          But this time, because I already have a better understanding of polymorphism (and its use), the SOLID principles, and other things, I tried to use those knowledge in my coding.
<!--           
          <br /><br />
          Also, when I learned that a new version of the app is to be made, I had this plan of creating a separate module where I can eventually transfer all the business rules into it
          <br /><br />
          Also, the code base I was working on has only one module because it was only a small project. This module contains the presentation layer (we were using MVP), and helper classes which is basically the business logic and data access layers combined. While working on version two of the app, I saw that some of the data-access leaked into the presentation layer. So when I heard that a new version of the app is to be made, I tried to do something to separate into another module the data layer from the presentation layer of the app. I was planning, through this separation, to slowly transfer the business rules into another module. And I was also hopeful that I can mold the app into a form where I can be able to do TDD in the business rules module when adding the new features for the new version of the app.
          <br /><br />
          But because I am not a master of the art of persuation, my plan was not pushed. :sad:
          <br /><br />
          Well, it did not matter that much to me because I knew that I was (and is still) not an expert on Android development, and there might be some issues that I know nothing about that might have made the separation bad for the future of the app.

          When developing for mobile, we have to make sure that the mobile app is responsive, so API access and database access should be done in a background thread. Dealing with this threads thing is messy. I still have to learn more about how to properly deal with threads.

## **More Lessons Learned**


<dl>

  <dt>The business rules must be separated</dt>
  <dd>
    There must be a very clear separation of the business logic layer from the other parts of the system. This will make it easier for new developers on the team to understand the domain the system is being built for, and easier when fixing bugs.
    <br />
    It doesn't matter how old or new the frameworks of libraries the team is currently using. If the business rules are not separated from the other parts of the system, time will come where it will be very hard for the developers to add new functionalities to the system, and to fix bugs.
  </dd>

  <dt>The code base should be taken care of</dt>
  <dd>
    Even if the code base started out to be clean, it will get messy if no one is checking how things are going when new features are added or when bugs are being fixed.
    <br />
    I believe that code review (or pair programming) and proper guidance/mentoring from those who are already familiar with the system can help solve this problem.

  <dt>Any member of the team must be allowed to speak up</dt>
  <dd>
    Sometimes a member of a team finds something wrong in the code base of the application he is involved in, and this wrong it is being propagated throughout the code base. It would be great if a team will let any member speak up if he sees something wrong in the code base, and that the team must do something to either convince everybody that it is not wrong or to fix the wrong.
  </dd>

  <dt>The team members must have a common set of values</dt>
  <dd>
    Before committing into a job, one must first ask about the standards or values of the team he will be involved in. If the team's values and his values match... then okay!
  </dd>

  <dt>System for asking help</dt>
  <dd>
    Sometimes programmers get stuck but are afraid to ask for help for some reasons only known to them. (My reason for being afraid of asking for help is because the person I will ask help from might be busy.)
    <br />
    I think doing pair programming from time to time can help make this awkwardness of asking questions go away.
    <br />
    But perhaps there are other ways to solve this problem.

## I am for hire as a "Business Rules Guardian"

With my current skillset, this is the best that I can give you: being a to _help_ guide each member of a team to separate the business rules from the other parts of the system. (Please note that I used the word _help_, because with this kind of task I will be needing the cooperation of each member of the team I will be involved in.)


It doesn't matter what frameworks/libraries you use, I can learn how to use them in a month

I prefer to be involved in a new system that will be developed from scratch.

1. You can hire me to become part of the team that will start a project from scratch. I will make sure that the business rules is separated from the other parts of the system. If I am not yet familiar with the language(s), frameworks/libraries that your team will use, I can spend about a month studying those things.


2. Help your team separate the business rules from the other parts of an software system.


3. Help in the maintenance mode of a well designed system.

<h2 id="preferences">
    <strong style="color: #6a9fb5">Some preferences with future work:</strong>
</h2>

NOTE: These are only _preferences_. I'm not trying to give mandates to the kind of work you should be giving me. :smile:

1. I would like to be involved in new projects that will be written from scratch, where I can have influence on the decisions that will be made (or at least I am in a position where I know the reasons behind the decisions being made).
<br /><br />
I would just like to add that if I will be involved in developing a new software from scratch, I would highly recommend using the [Clean Architecture model](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) of Uncle Bob Martin (or something similar to it), and use TDD also; because, as you might have already known, it is hard to create software that is _easy to change_. Many software developers believe that this Clean Architecture model and TDD can greatly help in making software easy to change.
<br /><br />
... also, our clients (and the programmers involved in the software project) will greatly benefit if we do something to make software easy to change.

2. And, if possible, I would also like to be mentored by someone who have much experience in the software development industry.

3. I'm also interested in mentoring beginning programmers because, as what Uncle Bob Martin points out [in one of his talks](https://youtu.be/BSaAMQVq01E?t=4277), "We're in a state of perpetual inexperience" because half of the programmers in the world have less than five years of experience.

I'm not yet an expert, but, as what I read in an [article about apprenticeship](https://s3.amazonaws.com/apprentice.us/Apprenticeship-Programs.pdf) by David H. Hoover, 
<br />
> "The mentor doesn't necessarily need to be a master of software development. In
fact, there are advantages to having a mentor who is closer in proximity to the
apprentice's level of experience."

4. If I will be working on an existing project, I might be needing lots of help in understanding the structure of the project in the first few weeks... most expecially when I am involved in a project where I am not yet familiar with the frameworks or libraries that are being used. 
<br /><br />
But if I will be involved in new projects... I believe that I can _help_ with the architecture of _new_ projects, even when I am not yet familiar with the specific frameworks and libraries that will be used in that project --- I can learn about the frameworks and libraries _inline_, I mean, during my vacant times. :smile:

Thank you! :smile:

I think I am enjoying more when I am involved design part of creating software systems --- by _design_ I mean the design or architecture of the software and not the UI part.

And because I concentrate on the _design_ part of the system, I think I can still be able to work on **new** projects even when I am not yet very familiar with the specific frameworks or libraries those projects, as long as my teammates are already familiar with the frameworks or libraries that we will be using.

I am kind of one who wants to help keep software from rotting --- and I would like to emphasize the word **_help_** because I can't do it on my own, most especially when I am not yet familiar with the technologies that will be used in the project.

I think I will also enjoy mentoring junior software developers.

I think I will be excited with work most when I am involved deciding about the architecture of new software system, or when I am involved in an existing software that has a good architecture, or when I am involved in a project whose team practices TDD.



I would also like to know what my responsibilities will be when I get hired.
