You think having an anti-r&eacute;sum&eacute; will put me at a disadvantage? ...

This anti-r&eacute;sum&eacute; (together with my [r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/resume/)) will help me find the best job that fits my current skillset, and it will help you in determining if I am fit for your team or not. That would be _win-win_ for me and you! :smile:

## **I never experienced being an Algorithmer**

In my [r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/resume#im-an-initiate), I considered myself as an **Initiate**, based on [Terence McGhee's "Software Ninja Class Hierarchy"](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2015/10/25/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html). But I never experienced being an **Algorithmer**, even though it is much lower than the Initiate in that hierarchy --- I do not have special knowledge in higher mathematics. (Please note that Terence McGhee places the Algorithmer in the same rank as the Chump Coder.)

But I can work with an Algorithmer, and I think I have a high respect for an Algorithmer, because I would have liked to experience being an Algorithmer had I given the chance (education) to become one. And I believe that working with an Algorithmer will benefit me --- I believe that I will learn a lot from an Algorithmer. I'm hoping also that he will learn a lot from me, if I will be working with one.


## **I'm not an expert on frameworks**

> "... Here's a possible surprise for you. I am not going to recommend that you need to become an Entity Framework guru. Nope, just the opposite in fact. I am going to suggest that you allow the Entity Framework development team to be the gurus, and you just focus on your specific application. After all, your Core Domain is where you want to put your creative energies, not in becoming an expert in Entity Framework."

You might say, _"What! Frameworks are the ones that make us do our work easily and fast! Why are you saying that being an expert on frameworks is not important?"_

Wait!... I am not saying that being an expert on frameworks is not important. What I am trying to say is that, in programming, there are more important things to focus on than being an expert on frameworks, such as separating the business rules from the other parts of the system. The business rules in a system are not googleable, so I believe that it is very important to separate them so that it will be very easy to locate them when fixing bugs.

(I intend to someday become an expert on some frameworks of course.)

You might ask, _"What is my excuse for not being an expert on frameworks?"_

... My excuse is this statement from "The Magic of Thinking Big", which I read from our school's library ten years ago
<sup id="footnote-indicator-1">[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup>:

> "It is more important to use your mind to think than use it as a warehouse for facts."
<br /><br />
> "The ability to know how to get information is more important than using the mind as a garage for facts"


Today, we already have [the] google [serach engine] which can serve as our garage for facts. We have StackOverflow too! And we have documentations for the frameworks we are using.

I would rather spend my time learning about how to write clean and decoupled code, and learning about software architecture and design, and learning about the domain of the project I am working on, than being an expert on frameworks. But like I said above, I'm still willing to read and study more about a specific framework when I think my job requires a deeper knowledge about that specific framework. :smile:

## **I have almost no knowledge about software security**

When it comes to security, I only know about SQL injection, and I know that it can be prevented by not using string concatenation when building SQL queries. But even though I know that using string concatenation is wrong when building SQL queries, I still do it sometimes, most especially when I'm tired, or bored, or when copy-pasting code from another part of the application I am working on. :grinning: But if you already have a set of guildelines for coding which I need to follow, or you practice code review or pair programming, then this will not be a problem. And I will be happy to work with a teammate who will correct me if I do not follow correct guidelines.

Oh, I also know about not storing passwords in plaintext, but instead hashing them before storing them. And I also know about not sending _forgotten passwords_ to users (because, of course, if we do not store passwords as plaintext, we will not know what password to email our users), but instead send them link to a form/resource that will let them change their passwords.

I also read, in the past, about Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF), but I already forgot what they are. All I know is that, to prevent these attacks in an ASP.NET MVC application, we only have to put a _specific_ Attribute in our Controller class or in a function inside a Controller class (I already forgot what that Attribute is), and that we must be cautious about the properties in our Model (or view model) that we expose to our users.

But I have a copy of the book ["24 Deadly Sins of Software Security"](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780071626750?a_aid=jflaga). So if you need me to become familiar with software security when working at your company, I can start with this book (or with any material you can recommend me to consume).



## **More to come...**

<sup id="footnote-1">[[1]](#footnote-indicator-1)</sup> <small>_(I have already forgotten most things I read from this book. But if you have also read this book, you can use some quotes in it to correct me someday when I'm already working with you and I did something wrong. But, of course, if the quote you will use is in disagreement with some of my core values, then I might try to defend myself. :smile: I hope you will also listen during those times when I try to defend myself.)_</small>

And I intend to be a expert on some frameworks someday.



Since about ten years ago I am influenced by this statement from "The Magic of Thinking Big"
<sup id="footnote-indicator-1">[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup>:

> "It is more important to use your mind to think than use it as a warehouse for facts."
<br /><br />
> "The ability to know how to get information is more important than using the mind as a garage for facts"


Today, we already have google which which can serve as our garage for facts. We have StackOverflow too!



Then when my first employer made us study DDD, and I learned about what they call having a _ubiquitous language_ between the business people and the programmers, and using the _ubiquituos language_ when creating the domain model, I _began_ to realize that this domain model thing is a very important part of a software system.




> uncle bob martin on web servers and databases and frameworks

As much as possible, I want to decouple my code from frameworks.
Of course that is not always possible if I will be working on existing projects.

You can hire me to _help_ you decouple your code from frameworks...


Please note that in my [Open Application Letter](/open-application-letter/), I never applied for a job where expertise in specific frameworks is needed. I only applied for jobs where the major tasks involves decoupling the business rules from frameworks. (Of course I understand that there are frameworks/libraries that we have to couple with the business rules, such as the standard libraries in Java or .NET.) If you need expertise in specific frameworks, I am not fit for that job, at least for now.



I have a considerable amount of knowledge about frameworks and their uses, but for now, I want to concentrate on creating domain models (and decoupling them from frameworks). I will just spend time to become am expert on frameworks later.



### Focused on separating the business logic from other parts of the system

Being influenced by people who promote DDD (Note: I only know a little about DDD), I am the kind of person who _would like to_ focus on learning about the domain of the business... and modeling that domain intead on focusing on the specifics of the frameworks or libraries being used in the software system I am involved in...

Giving more focus on the domain will help remove mistakes that 

If you will hire me to be part of a team that will make software from the start --- I believe that structuring a software project so that the business rules (or the domain model) is separated from the other parts of the software system is a very good way to start a project, even if the current state of the project is not yet very complex, because, as what Jimmy Bogard said in his talk "Crafting Wicked Domain Models", many software will become complex even if it did not start as complex.




If your team is still in the stage of being framework-focused, I might not work well with them. Except maybe if you want someone to be influential into making your team business-focused.

If I am hired I plan to spend at least half of my time (during the first few weeks or months) learning about the business and half of the time learning about the specific frameworks/libraries/technologies your team is using.

If I will 





### I'm the kind of person who is not comfortable accepting praise if I am not very confident about the project I'm working on. 







### I work very well, even during trying hours, _only if_ there is rapid feedback from the system I am working on

I'm a patient kind of man, I think, but I sometimes get impatient especially when it takes so much time to fix a problem which I think should be very easy to fix.

This impatience will be bolstered when it takes too long a time before I can be able to see whether the code I just wrote works or not.

A very long compilation time might be one of the reasons for a very slow feedback.

This problem can be solved if your system allows me to write fast (not slow) unit tests. So if I can write fast unit tests, this will not be a problem.

If the unit tests of your system run very slow, you might be interested in hiring me to _help_ fix the running time of your unit tests. Please note that I used the word _"help"_ because I will be needing the help of _at least_ one of your developers who is already very familiar with the system whose unit tests' running time you want to fix. It might be possible for me to fix it alone, but it will take way too much time and will give me (and you) too much unecessary frustrations if you allow me to do it alone.






### Wehn I get frustrated

when i get frustrated I sometimes think this: let those who make the mess be the ones to clean the mess. DOn't let them work on new projects unless they first clean up the mess that they made. If you want other people to clean up the mess that someone else made, be sure to pay him more that what you paid the one who made the mess.





### I sometimes get frustrated whn I know that something is wrong and I cannot do anything about it

It would be great if there is some kind of something where I am allowed to say it if I think we are doing something wrong, make suggestions as to how to solve it, and do that to solve it.

I will get frustrated sometime, or maybe oftentimes, when I know that we can do better with things but we are not doing something about it.


I would like to suggest that there be a system where a programmer can be able to raise his concerns about the existing code base if he thinks that there is something wrong in the system... and that we do something about it, or at least plan to do something about it.... to fix it later... because if a team does not do this, it seems to me that we are being dishonest to our employer, and to our clients.





It gives me this feeling that the memebers of the team do not seem to care.

It would be great if your company have this kind of system where I can be able to voice my opinion, for example, when I see something that we are doing which is bad. 

This kind of system will breed trust to each member of the team...


I don't want to play the blaming game because I don't know what my coleauges, managers or employer in the past were experiencings when they decided to do things the way they did them.


If you want to hear examples about this please ask me during the interview.


I understand that there are times when I don't need to ask for permission when I do something which I think will benefit my employers or my coleagues, but I just don't want to play politics, so I have to ask for permission about these things before I get hired.


Examples:

not decoupled code that I need to test

using RxJava






### I have almost no experience deploying things


But a coleague of mine once said that it is just almost the same as clicking the build button in an IDE. 

So if I am tasked of deployment and no one else is to guide me, I will just google how to do it. :smile:



### I only have basic knowledge about functional programming

All I know about functional programming is that the use of assignment is forbidden/discouraged and that there is heavy use of recursion.



### I know nothing about estimating

Today, the only method I have to honestly estimate the time to be spent to finish a project is to do at least two of the most important features of the app, then use the time spent on those two features to estimate the time that will be spent on the whole project.



### Cannot work on Android, except

I cannot work on Android projects for my next job because I promised my current employer that I will not be working on an Android project in my next job... except when I will be hired in _helping_ decouple your business (core) layer from the presentation layer or data layer or other layers in your system, because in that case, I will not be involved in working on the Android framework specific parts of project.



### I sometimes think about justice (seek for justice)


Let those who produced messy code be the ones to fix them. Don't give them another project to start until they fix their mess.

Well, I am very bold in saying that because I never experienced being involved in a software project from the very start. I only experienced in the maintenance mode of software projects.

But, as every adult might have already realized, we do not always get justice in this life. So I intend to help those who experience injustice by helping them fix the mess that was the result of it's creators' abandonment.

But if the creators of the system did not abandon their work, and is still working on it right now, and they know that it is a mess but do not know how to fix it, I am also willing to help.

You see, I believe in a personal Designer of the universe --- a Designer who is still cares about his creation (even though his creation do not seem to care about him)

But of course in the real world, that does not always happen.

I think I can help in fixing messy software. I'm now Micheal Feathers so if the mess is very big already, I might not be able to fix it. If it is still small and 






Please note that I only read 





### I almost wanted to give up on software development in the past

In my first job, I was very excited

  -  leaned about twitter ...


In my second job


So i will not work with you unless I'll be working in a new project where I will have influence about he structure/architecture of the project, or I will be working on an existing project that does not look like it was abandoned by it's designers, or I will be fixing an existing mess.... AND I can mentor the next person that will someday take care of the project I am currently working on (Or the current best designers in you company will mentor me)


Being influenced by people who promote DDD (Note: I only know a little about DDD), I already got past being a framework-focused developer to being a business-model-focused developer.

If your team is still in the stage of being framework-focused, I might not work well with them. Except maybe if you want someone to be influential into making your team business-focused.




### I have a hidden agenda

I want to help spread this idea of professionalism in the sovtware development comunity.




### I'm not very patient wehn working with the UI

I'm not very good with UI. But I can manage to workin with UIs if I need to work on them.

But if I will be working with a visual designer, I believe that he will not be having a problem working with me beause I intend to decouple my code from the UI so that my code will not be very affected with UI changes and UI changes will not affect so much my code.




### I don't know how to do this CQRS and Event Sourcing thing

... even thought I think this will have a very important role in the next few years
