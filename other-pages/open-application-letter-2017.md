Good day Sir/Ma'am,

I would like to apply to work on a .NET project in your company.

But I believe I can be able to work with _any_ technology stack (I mean, _any_ technology stack that uses an object-oriented programming language), most especially when the original designers and current designers of the software I will be involved in structured their software so that it can be easily understood by others.

If you have a team that uses TDD as one of their practices, please let me be involved in that team (even if the team is not using .NET technologies). If the project is small or medium in size, I believe I can be able to contribute after about a month of familiarizing myself with the technology stack being used in that project (with the help of my teammates, of course :smile:).

I prefer to be involved in a team that uses TDD because I believe that, today, if a team uses TDD as part of their practices, it is a very good indication that the members of that team cares _so much_ about their work, and about their teammates (and, of course, their clients).

(I'm not saying that those who do not practice TDD do not care. I'm just saying that those who practice TDD cares _more_.)

If you do not have a team that uses TDD, I would like to be involved in a team that has code reviews (and/or pair programming) as one of their practices. I want to be involved in that kind of team because, I believe, the team that practices code reviews (and/or pair programming) also indicates that that team cares _so much_ about their work, and their teammates (and, of course, their clients).

If you do not have a project where the team involved practices TDD and/or code reviews (and/or pair programming), please let me be involved in a project that is still small in size...

If...

If you have a project that has not yet started...

You might deem those statements of mine as arrogant.
