It's not whether one is biased or not because everyone has a bias. It's a matter of which bias is the best bias with which to be biased.

--- Ken Ham


Most people today have not given much thought to their own worldview. In fact, many people do not even realize they have a worldview. Many people tend to think that all knowledge is acquired by unbiased observation of the evidence around us. This view is called "empiricism" and is itself a kind of worldview. We cannot help but have some beliefs about how the world works, how we attain knowledge, and how we should live. Even if we believe that we have no such beliefs --- this is itself a belief. So there's no escaping it. **A worldview is inevitable.** A rational worldview is not.

--- Jason Lisle



When it comes to the political and cultural left and right in this country [USA], it’s not that on one side there are those who want to control information and those on the other side who do not; it’s all a matter of what kind of information which side wants to control. When it comes to this kind of question judgmentalism is found everywhere; it’s just a question of who’s making the judgment and what kind of judgment one is making.

"If you don't know something about apples to begin with, you can't devise a method for separating them.
And in the same way, if you don't know something about the universe to begin with, if you don't know something about reality to begin with, if you don't know something about the difference between truth and error about the universe to begin with, you cannot devise a method that separates the true conclusions from the false conclusions about reality."

You can't even devise an epistemology --- an apple sorting machine --- unless you already know something about reality; unless you already know something about the apples to begin with

"**Everyone begins with a worldview.** Everyone begins with a certain view about reality. And in terms of that perception, that conception of reality, you devise your epistemology ---  your theory of knowledge --- and so neutrality is indeed impossible."

--- Greg Bahnsen



## Other quotes which might not be _directly_ related to this "biased" thing, but still related, I believe

"I believe that we need to have our theories prior to our interpretation of the facts.

Theories are eyeglasses and we put that for us to be able to read."

--- Dr. Peter Boettke
