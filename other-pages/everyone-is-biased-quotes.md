First things first...

I'm a _biased_ person, and one of my set of biases is this: **_"everyone is biased"_**, including you and me. (That means that my being biased is consistent with one of my set of biases.) If you say that you are _neutral_, then that is already proof that you are _biased_ because you already stated your disagreement with me (and with many others who believe that everyone has his own set of biases).  :grinning:

On some issues, I think my set of biases on that issue is the best, [so I hold on to them tightly. But I'm still learning.](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2012/09/16/have-strong-convictions-but-hold-on-to-them-loosely/) I might change my mind on some issues later if I will be convinced that my set of biases are wrong.

Here are some quotes about this _"everyone is biased"_ thing.


> **It is not a matter of whether one is biased or not. It is really a question of which bias is the best bias with which to be biased.**
<br /><br />
> Occasionally people are upset when dogmatic statements are made. They say, "You cannot be dogmatic like that." This in itself is a dogmatic statement. Many think that some people are dogmatic and others are not. **It is not a matter of whether you are dogmatic or not, but of which dogma is the best dogma with which to be dogmatized!**
<br /><br />
> --- Ken Ham (from ["The Lie: Evolution"](https://answersingenesis.org/christianity/christianity-is-under-attack/))



> Most people today have not given much thought to their own worldview. In fact, many people do not even realize they have a worldview. Many people tend to think that all knowledge is acquired by unbiased observation of the evidence around us. This view is called "empiricism" and is itself a kind of worldview. We cannot help but have some beliefs about how the world works, how we attain knowledge, and how we should live. Even if we believe that we have no such beliefs --- this is itself a belief. So there's no escaping it. **A worldview is inevitable.** A rational worldview is not.

> When it comes to the political and cultural left and right in this country, it’s not that on one side there are those who want to control information and those on the other side who do not; it’s all a matter of what kind of information which side wants to control. When it comes to this kind of question judgmentalism is found everywhere; it’s just a question of who’s making the judgment and what kind of judgment one is making.

> "If you don't know something about apples to begin with, you can't devise a method for separating them.
And in the same way, if you don't know something about the universe to begin with, if you don't know something about reality to begin with, if you don't know something about the difference between truth and error about the universe to begin with, you cannot devise a method that separates the true conclusions from the false conclusions about reality."
<br /><br />
You can't even devise an epistemology --- an apple sorting machine --- unless you already know something about reality; unless you already know something about the apples to begin with.
<br /><br />
"**Everyone begins with a worldview.** Everyone begins with a certain view about reality. And in terms of that perception, that conception of reality, you devise your epistemology ---  your theory of knowledge --- and so neutrality is indeed impossible."
<br /><br />
> --- Greg Bahnsen (from his lecture on "The Myth of Neutrality")



> Part 1 of Dr. Greg Bahnsen’s video lecture series, Basic Training For Defending the Faith, is titled "The Myth of Neutrality." The title sums up the lesson succintly: neutrality is a myth. In this lecture, **Dr. Bahnsen teaches that the idea of neutrality --- be it intellectual, philosophical, emotional, scientific, or in any other area --- is a myth**. You see and read several passages of Scripture that prove this. Jesus spoke definitively about this (Matthew 6:24, Matthew 12:30).

> "I believe that we need to have our theories prior to our interpretation of the facts.
<br /><br />
"Theories are eyeglasses and we put that for us to be able to read."
