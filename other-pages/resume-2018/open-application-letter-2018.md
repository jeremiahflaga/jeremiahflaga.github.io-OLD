Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I already resigned from my current job so please don't be alarmed about this "open application letter" thing (I, kind of, already have permission from my current employer to do this). I promise that, when I get hired at your company, I will not be sending "open application letters" to other companies while I'm still employed at your company. :smile:

My purpose for this open application letter is to make it easy for me to apply for jobs, and to make it easy for recruiters to determine if my current skillset matches with what their team need.


I'm Jeremiah

I am available for the following positions:

.NET Programmer
Design Partner

Design Guardian (for new projects, through TDD)
TDD Preacher
TDD Guide
TDD Law Enforcer

### (a) .NET Programmer

I have about four years of experience working using .NET.

If I will be hired as a .NET developer, I prefer to be involved in the Web API part of the system because I'm not very good with the UI part of a software system.

But if your Web API team is full already, then I have to push myself to be good at the UI also :smile:


> Don't be an EF expert. Let the creators of EF be the expert with EF


### (b) Design Partner

By "design" I mean "software design".

Perhaps you have someone in your team a very good sofware designer, or a budding designer, and you want to keep him for the next years to come. One way of doing that, I think, is to give him a design partner, because he might get stuck sometimes, or feel unmotivated sometimes, or feel like abandoning his disciplines just to solve a problem quickly, and he needs someone to talk to or share his ideas with. I can be that someone.




### (c) A Thinking Rubber Duck


Some of our master programmers advise us to bring with us a rubber duck in the office, and try to explain to that rubber duck our problem when we feel like we are stuck with that problem.

But many programmers do not do that because their coleagues might think that they look like an idiot talking to a rubber duck.

I can replace that rubber duck instead because some programmers might need to talk to someone who can think with them and _help_ them solve the problem.



Through this, I can also become familiar with the whole system and might someday help with bringing the code into being testable.



### (d) Design Guardian (for new projects, through TDD)

Software systems with good design saves a lot of time and headaches for programmers when they need to change something, or when they need to add new features, or when they have a bug to fix.

That, of course, means that it will also save a lot of time and headaches for business people, and for the end-users of the software systems. 

I believe (like Micheal Feathers, Uncle Bob Martin, and many others do) that systems which have good design are systems that are _testable_.

> "If your code is not testable, then it is not well designed."
<br /><br />
> "In general, every time you encounter a testability problem, there is an underlying design problem."
<br /><br />
> --- Micheal Feathers (from "The Deep Synergy Between Testability and Good Design")

Simple rule, right?

_Not testable?... The design must be wrong!_

And what better way do we have today to ensure testability than TDD!

Test-Driven Development (TDD), is a very good way of ensuring that a software system is testable. And testable systems give a very good indication that it is a well designed system (which, like I said above, saves a lot of programmers' time and saves a lot of time of business people's time...)


... But I think that I can only do this role if I am involved in a project from the very start. So you can hire me for this position only if you have a new project which you want to be testable.



You might ask, "How are you going to do this?"

First of all, it would be best if I have a design partner, or you will assign me as partner of your best software designer.

Well, I will do what 


I' not a proponent of good design just for the sake of having a good design. I'm a proponent of good design because it helps in eliminating bugs, and good design helps in eliminating errors that programmers can make.


### (e) TDD Preacher/Guide

> "... preaching sermons to the unconverted in the hope of redeeming them (or at least their code)." Tomek Kaczanowski



### (f) TDD Law Enforcer

 We programmers are lazy sometimes. We tend not to care about things --- "as long as it is working, it is okay"

 You might need someone to enforce TDD and not abandon that discipline even during times of crisis and panic.

    "The only way to go fast is to go well" ---- Uncle Bob Martin



### Other

the jobs above might sound good to, but I got those description because of previous experiences


it's possible that what you need is not in the list... but if you suspect that i am fit for that kind of job, please contact me with the details of the kind of job you are offering and I will see if I will be able to do it.





### About sideline jobs

In my five years of being a software developer, I experienced having a sideline job ony once, and it lasted only one month, because I noticed that having a sideline job does not help me reach some goals i want to reach, such as learning how to create well designed software systems, and learning how to be good at fixing messes which I and other programmers made. 

Because of that, you will be sure that when I sleep at night, I will only be dreaming about the problems that I encounter while working at your company, and not about problems of other companies.



### I don't think I'm mean

I believe that being mean will pugong my goal of fixing software systems (when I'm hired to fix one), because I know that I can work alone when fixing existing software systems.




### In case I did not pass the standard of your senior developer(s)

... I can become his apprentice, teaching me about design and other things, so that I can pass on his legacy to the next generation of programmers.

Good day Sir/Ma'am,

I am Jeremiah M. Flaga, a software developer for about five years already.

I experienced being involved in .NET projects for about four years and in an Android project for about a year.


But I believe that I can be able to work on an existing software that uses _any_ technology stack _(with the help of teammates, of course, and of the google search engine)_, most especially when the original designers and current designers of the software structured it so that it can be _easily_ understood by others.


I believe that if you are doing TDD, that means that you are thinking about your future, 
and I want to be involved with a team that brings good

It will be hard for that company to die because they will be making clients happy most of the time, if not all the time. I want to work for that kind of company.



I would like to apply for a job at your company. If you have lots of teams, and I have the freedom to choose which team I want to work with, I would prefer working on a team that creates Web APIs using ASP.NET WebAPI with [TDD](/tdd-quotes/). _(I prepared for ASP.NET WebAPI development by reading the book ["Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001708) which is freely available online.)_


applying in consulting companies.


If you are not using TDD yet, I encourage you to use it because that would be one way of making sure that your employees will not leave you suddenly. TDD is not yet widely used. And many developers who experienced doing TDD do not want to look back or abandon this kind of practice because of the many benefits that it gives them.



If you embrace TDD now, you will attract good designers into your comapny, which will leave other companies wanting good designers. But if that will not happen, at least you helped raise the bar of professionalism in the software development world, while acquiring good designers in the process.





If you have a team that uses [TDD](/tdd-quotes/) as one of their practices, I would like to request you to please let me be involved in that team :smile: (even if the team is _not_ using technologies I am specifically familiar with). If the project is small or medium in size, I believe I can be able to contribute after about a month of familiarizing myself with the technology stack being used in that project (with the help of my teammates, of course :smile:).

I prefer to be involved in a team that uses [TDD](/tdd-quotes/) because I believe that, _today,_ if a team uses TDD as part of their practices, it is a very good indication that the members of that team cares _so much_ about their work, and about their teammates (and, of course, their clients).

_(I'm not saying that those who do not practice TDD do not care. I'm just saying that those who practice TDD cares 'more'.)_

If you do not have a team that uses TDD, I would like to be involved in a team that has code reviews (and/or pair programming) as part of their practices. I want to be involved in that kind of team because, I believe, if a team practices code reviews (and/or pair programming), it indicates that that team cares _so much_ about their work, and their teammates (and, of course, their clients).

_(I'm not saying that those who do not practice code reviews and/or pair programming do not care. I'm just saying that those who practice them cares 'more'.)_

If you do not have a team that practices TDD and/or pair programming

Thank you so much for your time. :smile:




Other programmers might be afraid to mentor because they fear that the one they are mentoring might be the one to replace them in the future.

But my reason for mentoring is so that I can learn from those I am mentoring, not only so that I can teach them what I know. And that means that I will still not become replacable. :smile:




I would prefer working on the Web API part of your software system, because I am not bery good with working with UIs.

But if the team that uses TDD also works with UIs, then I will work with them rather than...









<!--
It would also be great working with you if your company has an existing mentoring program, or something like that, for beginning programmers. :+1:

 ### A Human rubber duck

 I might not be the best designer you will ever have, but if you let me talk to people about design, or teach them a little bit about design, that might trigger the designer part within those developers and they will try to become better designers themselves.




-----------------

I must be allowed to question everything.
I, also, am willing to be questioned about every decision that I make (or made), and I promise I will be very willing to change that decision if I am convinced with the argument of the one who questions.
