From a selfish point of view, an antiresume will 

An antiresume will also save a lot of time for recruiters to determine if a candidate is fit for their team or not.



### I'm an initiate


Using [Terence McGhee's "Software Ninja Class Hierarchy"](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2015/10/25/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html), I consider myself to be (at least) an **_"initiate"_**, because I try to write code that is easy to read. I do that because I know that programmers spend more time reading code that writing code. I'm not saying that I _always_ write code that is easy to read (I still write messy code during _trying_ times or during _boring_ times), but I'm already aware, through experience, that code that is easy to read is valuable code.

But I think you can still forgive me if I consider myself a **_Level Zero Codesmith_** (Please note that in programming, _"zero"_ has meaning other than _"none"_ :grin:) because I have little knowledge about TDD, the SOLID principles, Clean/Decoupled Architecture, and some Design Patterns .



### I'm not an expert on frameworks


Since about ten years ago, I am influenced by this statement from "The Magic of Thinking Big" (I have already forgotten most things I read from this book. But if you have also read this book, you can use some quotes in it to correct me someday when I'm already working with you and I did something wrong. But, of course, if the quote you will use is in disagreement with some of my core values, then I might try to defend myself. :smile: I hope you will also listen during those times when I try to defend myself.)

ASP.NET Web Forms
ASP.NET MVC
Entity Framework




Today, we already have google which serves as our garage for facts.



### I work very well, even during trying hours, only if there is rapid feedback

I'm a patient kind of man, I think, but I sometimes get impatient especially when it takes so much time to fix a problem which I think should be very easy to fix.

This impatience will be bolstered when it takes too long a time before I can be able to see whether the code I just wrote works or not.

A very long compilation time might be one of the reasons for a very slow feedback.

This problem can be solved if your system allows me to write fast (not slow) unit tests (tests that do not take too much time to run also, of course). So if I can write fast unit tests, this will not be a problem.

If the unit tests of your system run very slow, you might be interested in hiring me to _help_ fix the running time of your unit tests. Please note that I used the word _"help"_ because I will be needing the help of _at least_ one of your developers who is already very familiar with the system whose unit tests' running time you want to fix. It might be possible for me to fix it alone, but it will take way too much time and will give me (and you) too much unecessary frustrations if you allow me to do it alone.



### I have almost no knowledge about software security

When it comes to security, I only know about SQL injection, and I know that it can be prevented by not using string concatenation when building SQL queries. (But even though I know that using string concatenation is wrong when building SQL queries, I still do it sometimes, most especially when I'm tired, or bored, or when copy-pasting code from another part of the application I am working on. :grinning: But if you already practice code review or pair programming, then this will not be a problem)

Oh, I also know about not storing passwords in plaintext but, instead, hashing them before storing them. And I also know about not sending _forgotten passwrods_ to users (because, of course, if we do not store passwords as plaintext, we will not know what password to email our users), but instead, send them link to a form/resource that will let them change their passwords.

I also read, in the past, about Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF), but I already forgot what they are. All I know is that, to prevent these attacks in an ASP.NET MVC application, we only have to put a _specific_ Attribute in our Controller class or in a function inside a Controller class (I already forgot what that Attribute is), and that we must be cautious about the properties in our Model (or view model) that we expose to our users.

But I have a copy of the book "24 Deadly Sins of Software Security". So if you need me to become familiar with software security when working at your company, I can start with this book (or with any material you can recommend for me to consume).
