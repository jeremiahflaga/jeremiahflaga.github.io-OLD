Reading blog posts like this one is a baby step: hopefully it'll help a bit, but it's the tip of the iceberg. I'd really recommend concentrating your reading more on classic books that'll help you throughout your career. Book authors have spent many months, maybe years, distilling their years of experience into a well-crafted format that you can inhale over a few weekends.

Being willing to read is a superpower in our industry. It really is.
