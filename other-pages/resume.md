<h2 id="preferences">
    <strong style="color: #6a9fb5">Some preferences with future work:</strong>
</h2>

NOTE: These are only _preferences_. I'm not trying to give mandates to the kind of work you should be giving me. :smile:

1. I would like to be involved in new projects that will be written from scratch, where I can have influence on the decisions that will be made (or at least I am in a position where I know the reasons behind the decisions being made).
<br /><br />
I would just like to add that if I will be involved in developing a new software from scratch, I would highly recommend using the [Clean Architecture model](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) of Uncle Bob Martin (or something similar to it), and use TDD also; because, as you might have already known, it is hard to create software that is _easy to change_. Many software developers believe that this Clean Architecture model and TDD can greatly help in making software easy to change.
<br /><br />
... also, our clients (and the programmers involved in the software project) will greatly benefit if we do something to make software easy to change.

2. And, if possible, I would also like to be mentored by someone who have much experience in the software development industry.

3. I'm also interested in mentoring beginning programmers because, as what Uncle Bob Martin points out [in one of his talks](https://youtu.be/BSaAMQVq01E?t=4277), "We're in a state of perpetual inexperience" because half of the programmers in the world have less than five years of experience.

I'm not yet an expert, but, as what I read in an [article about apprenticeship](https://s3.amazonaws.com/apprentice.us/Apprenticeship-Programs.pdf) by David H. Hoover, 
<br />
> "The mentor doesn't necessarily need to be a master of software development. In
fact, there are advantages to having a mentor who is closer in proximity to the
apprentice's level of experience."

4. If I will be working on an existing project, I might be needing lots of help in understanding the structure of the project in the first few weeks... most expecially when I am involved in a project where I am not yet familiar with the frameworks or libraries that are being used. 
<br /><br />
But if I will be involved in new projects... I believe that I can _help_ with the architecture of _new_ projects, even when I am not yet familiar with the specific frameworks and libraries that will be used in that project --- I can learn about the frameworks and libraries _inline_, I mean, during my vacant times. :smile:

Thank you! :smile:

I think I am enjoying more when I am involved design part of creating software systems --- by _design_ I mean the design or architecture of the software and not the UI part.

And because I concentrate on the _design_ part of the system, I think I can still be able to work on **new** projects even when I am not yet very familiar with the specific frameworks or libraries those projects, as long as my teammates are already familiar with the frameworks or libraries that we will be using.

I am kind of one who wants to help keep software from rotting --- and I would like to emphasize the word **_help_** because I can't do it on my own, most especially when I am not yet familiar with the technologies that will be used in the project.

I think I will also enjoy mentoring junior software developers.

I think I will be excited with work most when I am involved deciding about the architecture of new software system, or when I am involved in an existing software that has a good architecture, or when I am involved in a project whose team practices TDD.



I would also like to know what my responsibilities will be when I get hired.
