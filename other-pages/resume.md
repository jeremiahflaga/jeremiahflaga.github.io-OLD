I think I am enjoying more when I am involved design part of creating software systems --- by _design_ I mean the design or architecture of the software and not the UI part.

And because I concentrate on the _design_ part of the system, I think I can still be able to work on **new** projects even when I am not yet very familiar with the specific frameworks or libraries those projects, as long as my teammates are already familiar with the frameworks or libraries that we will be using.

I am kind of one who wants to help keep software from rotting --- and I would like to emphasize the word **_help_** because I can't do it on my own, most especially when I am not yet familiar with the technologies that will be used in the project.

I think I will also enjoy mentoring junior software developers.

I think I will be excited with work most when I am involved deciding about the architecture of new software system, or when I am involved in an existing software that has a good architecture, or when I am involved in a project whose team practices TDD.



I would also like to know what my responsibilities will be when I get hired.
