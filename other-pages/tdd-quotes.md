I believe, like Uncle Bob Martin does, that, _today_, TDD (or Test-Driven Development) is one of the hallmarks of professionalism in the software development world.

So I would like to convince myself and my fellow software developers to embrace TDD. :smile:

Ergo, these quotes...



#### Uncle Bob Martin ([So... You want your code to be maintainable?](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/so-you-want-your-code-to-be-maintainable))

> "**Nothing makes a system more flexible than a suite of tests.** 
<br /><br />
Nothing. 
<br /><br />
Good architecture and design are important; but the effect of a robust suite of tests is **an order of magnitude greater**. It’s so much greater because those tests enable you to improve the design.
<br /><br />
> "This can’t be overstated. If you want your systems to be flexible, write tests. If you want your systems to be reusable, write tests. If you want your systems to be maintainable, write tests.
<br /><br />
"And write your tests using the Three Laws of TDD."



#### Joshua Kerievsky (Refactoring to Patterns)

> "Test-driven development and continuous refactoring, two of the many excellent XP practices, have dramatically improved the way I build software. 
<br /><br />
>" I’ve found that these two practices have helped me and the organizations I’ve worked for **spend less time over-engineering and under-engineering** and more time creating high-quality, function-rich code, produced on time."



#### Michael Feathers (Working Effectively with Legacy Code)

> "**Code without tests is bad code.** It doesn't matter how well written it is; it doesn't
matter how pretty or object-oriented or well encapsulated it is.
<br /><br />
> "With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse."



#### Uncle Bob Martin ([TDD Harms Architecture](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/03/03/TDD-Harms-Architecture.html)) 

> "The idea that the high level design and architecture of a system emerge from TDD is, frankly, absurd. **Before you begin to code any software project, you need to have some architectural vision in place. TDD will not, and can not, provide this vision.** That is not TDD’s role."
