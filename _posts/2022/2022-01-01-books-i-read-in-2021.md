**NOTE: This is a work in progress --- the reason why the date is Jan 1, 0001.** :smile:


> **"The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed."** - Peter Block (through Woody Zuill in the beginning of his [talk on "Mob Programming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLEsWB1wZMA))


Following what [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/books-read-2017/) had been doing, and to encourage myself to continue reading and learning, I am listing here the books I have read the past year.


**Here is my list for 2021:**

<!--more-->


<small>NOTE: Many of my readings here are what [Mortimer Adler](https://www.bookdepository.com/How-Read-Book-Mortimer-J-Adler/9781476790152?a_aid=jflaga) calls _Inspectional Reading_ . You cannot expect me to have already _mastered_ all the materials presented in the books listed below. I will have to reread them to master them. :smile: </small>

#### "Stealing from God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case" <small>by Frank Turek</small>

<!-- Jan 3 - Feb 3 -->

> Chistianity is not --- contrary to popular opnion --- all about having your good deeds outweigh your bad deeds.
>
> **Christianity is not about being good. Christianity is about being redeemed.** (p. 221)

> God can't force us to love Him. Love, by definition, must be freely given; it cannot be coerced.  (p. 223)


I found something that is kind of a slap to the face of my libertarian inclination :grin::

> ... In fact, many atheists want to legislate their own morality.
>
> Oh, you can't legislate morality!
>
> News flash: All laws legislate morality... So the question is not whether we can legislat emorality, but "Whose morality will we legislate?"
>
> Many don't realize this because they lump morality and religion together. But laws can and do legislate morality without legislating religion... (p. 106)

#### "Are Your Lights On? How to Know What The Problem Really Is" <small>by Donald C. Gause & Gerald M.Weinberg</small>

<!-- Jan 6 - 8 -->

> We never get rid of problems. Problems, solutions, and new problems weave an endless chain. The best we can hope for is that the problems we substitute are less troublesome than the ones we "solve."

... Remember Thomas Sowell's _"There are no solutions; only tradeoffs"!_

> Designers, like landlords, seldom if ever experience the consequences of their actions. In consequence, designers continually produce misfits. A misfit is a solution that produces a mismatch with the human beings who have to live with the solution.

... Something software designers need to remember??

> DON'T SOLVE OTHER PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS WHEN THEY CAN SOLVE THEM PERFECTLY WELL THEMSELVES. 
>
> Not only did the interested parties know and feel much more about the problem, but after creating "their" solution, they were ego-involved in seeing that it was carried out.

> We've already seen how many problems in our society stem from systems designers and decision makers who don't experience the problems they're "responsible" for.

> Approaching public servants with courtesy and respect for their humanity and competence will, for the most part, evoke humanity and competence.

... Interesting :smiley:

> ... the source of the problem is most often within you.

... :grimacing:

#### "Mere Christianity" <small>by C.S. Lewis</small>

<!-- 3rd reading of books 3 and 4: Feb 4 - Mar 2 -->
<!-- 4th reading of book 1: April 17 - 25 -->

<!-- <small><small>(Books 1, 3 and 4)</small></small> -->

I like reading this book over and over again since the first time I read it last August 2019...

> It is after you have realized that there is a real Moral Law, and a Power behind the law, and that you have broken that law and put yourself wrong with that Power --- it is after all this, and not a moment sooner, that Christianity begins to talk. When you know you are sick, you will listen to the doctor. When you have realised that our position is nearly desperate you will begin to understand what the Christians are talking about. **They offer an explanation of how we got into our present state of both hating goodness and loving it.** (p. 31)

> Of course, I quite agree that the Christian religion is, in the long run, a thing of unspeakable comfort. But it does not begin in comfort; it begins in the dismay I have been describing, and it is no use at all trying to go on to that comfort without first going through that dismay.
>
> **If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end: if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth**...  (p. 32)

#### "ReChurch: Healing Your Way Back to the People of God" <small>by Stephen Mansfield</small>

<!-- 2nd reading: Mar 9 - 18 -->

> perfection is not the only door to significance. (p. 22)

> Here is the lesson: Great men and women of God are not exempt from hurt and offence. Instead, enduring the wounds of fellow Christians with mercy and grace seems to be the call of every true saint, and we should not expect it to be any different in our own lives.
>
> Indeed, it seems that the greater a man is in God, the more opposition from fellow believers he is forced to endure. (p. 30)

#### "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" <small>by Randal Bryant & David O'Hallaron</small>

Recommended for self-taught programmers in [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

> If the idea of self-studying 9 topics over multiple years feels overwhelming, we suggest you focus on just two books: **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** and Designing Data-Intensive Applications. In our experience, these two books provide incredibly high return on time invested, particularly for self-taught engineers and bootcamp grads working on networked applications. They may also serve as a "gateway drug" for the other topics...

Also recommended [here](https://xianminx.github.io/2013/02/28/computer-system-a-programmer-perspective/):

> CSAPP is such a book that can help you understand the overall blueprint for computer science, or at least, programming.

#### "Wired for Intimacy: How Pornography Hijacks the Male Brain" <small>by William M. Struthers</small>

Recommended by Albert Mohler in ["The Briefing 09-29-17"](https://albertmohler.com/2017/09/29/briefing-09-29-17).

> In opposition to porneia, the apostle Paul offers an alternative: purity. For the Christian, purity is not limited to our sexual behavior but is the result of the process of sanctification. In his letter to the Philippians, Paul instructs, “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things” (Phil 4:8). Purity is as much a matter of the mind as it is of the body, and it is important not to separate the two. The thoughts we think affect our body. The behaviors that we engage in affect our thinking. The interaction between thought and body is rooted in the neurobiology of the brain. Thoughts and behavior are woven together and intertwined with one another. This is how pornography and unhealthy sexuality pollutes the brain and the body together.
