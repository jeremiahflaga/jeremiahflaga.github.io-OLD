About two years ago, I inherited this project which does not have unit tests. Now, because I was brainwashed to write tests so that 


I started writing tests for the the services or use cases part. But I noticed that sometimes I still break existing functionality to those use cases I have written tests for... 

so I created tests for the ASP.NET Controllers instead... I sometimes break existing functionality when I refactor.

So I created tests from the outside, using HttpClient. I was thinking that that ind of test is called acceptance tests, but I was not so sure, so I called them API Endpoint Tests.

I had some success in doing that, but those tests were later abandoned because the data structures for the API request/response input/output are so big (because they are bing reused in different endpoints) that it takes lots of time to trace which ones are being used in an endpoint...
