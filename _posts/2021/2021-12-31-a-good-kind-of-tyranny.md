I'm not yet sure about the truthfulnes of the things written in this post, but writing helps in the development of ideas, so i'm going to write them anyway and publish them (because publishing what I write is a very good motivation for me to write things, for now)


Why do software developers like to design things? - what you want to say here is that we want our designs to be the one used in the system because we think that we know better -- I'm guilty of this myself


_Maybe_ because Fred Brooks said:

> My first proposal is that each software organization must determine and proclaim that great designers are as important to its success as great managers are, and that they can be expected to be similarly nurtured and rewarded. --- [No Silver Bullet](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Outreach/pc204/NoSilverBullet.html)


Maybe not.

It might have been the other way around: _maybe_ Fred Brooks wrote that statement above because he observed that many softare developers like to design things...



It could be that that the reason why developers want to design things is because programming is an intellectual kind of work...... and and we want to use our knowledge to design things


(Just like the temptation of intellectuals in the real world, they want to design things instead of trusting what others have observed as the invisible hand.)

Maybe this is just how things work:
	
Things start as chaotic

Then there is some kind of good tyranny

The tyranny has golden age

Then the good tyrants were replaced by bad tyrants (because like what C.S Lewis says: the evil goes to the top then things break)

The tyranny falls

Back to chaos

One solution might be to keep a separate copy of the project but with minimal features, where someone with design ideas can practice implementing his ideas there









als, Uncle Bob said in his book Clean Architecture that architecture adds complexity but helps as the software grows, and it's harder if we add it a bit late in the project


also include here the phrase which says that architecture is that part of the software which does not change that much... I'm not sure where I read that, maybe from Martin Fowler. I'm not sure also if that description is right or wrong.
