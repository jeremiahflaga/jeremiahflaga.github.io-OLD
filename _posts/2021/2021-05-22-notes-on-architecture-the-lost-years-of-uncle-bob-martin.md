Thomas Pierrain's [articles](https://tpierrain.blogspot.com/2016/04/hexagonal-layers.html) on [hexagonal](https://tpierrain.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-zoom-on-hexagonalcleanonion.html) architecture, and his [articles on "Outside-in Diamond TDD"](https://tpierrain.blogspot.com/2021/03/outside-in-diamond-tdd-1-style-made.html) (which I need to spend more time on later to understand it full well) brought back my interest for Clean Architecture.

I have things in mind to write about it... and so...

A link to Uncle Bob Martin's talk on Clean Architecture is needed in my [next](/2021/05/30/clean-architecture-of-uncle-bob-martin-in-aspnet-mvc-web-api) [blog](/2021/09/12/hello-world-layered-vs-clean-architecture) posts. But, where is my post transcribing his talks about it!?

[Nothing. I found nothing.](/2017/04/15/agility-and-architecture-by-uncle-bob-martin-oop-2015-keynote/) I got lazy transcribing my handwritten notes a few years ago.

My treasured learning from Uncle Bob: Clean Architecture --- and I do not have an existing post dedicated to his talks about it!?

Therefore, this post.

I'll just put here the scanned copies of my notes instead of transcribing them to typewritten text.



<!-- 
In [an old blog post](/2017/04/15/agility-and-architecture-by-uncle-bob-martin-oop-2015-keynote/), I said that I will post my Uncle Bob Martin's talk "Architecture: The Lost Years". I got lazy transcribing my handwritten notes during that time, so... I do not have an existing post dedicated to Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture!!

But I need to link to those notes in my next blog post, so I will put my scanned handwritten notes here so I will have something to link to

## Some resources which talks about the similarity between Clean, Hexagonal, Onion, Ports & Adapters and other similar architectures:


["The Clean Architecture"](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)


["A zoom on the hexagonal/clean/onion architecture"](https://tpierrain.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-zoom-on-hexagonalcleanonion.html)  by Thomas Pierrain (his post ["Hexagonal != Layers"](https://tpierrain.blogspot.com/2016/04/hexagonal-layers.html) is also very good!


["Layers, Onions, Ports, Adapters: it's all the same"](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/12/03/layers-onions-ports-adapters-its-all-the-same/) by Mark Seemann
