I heard someone in the past who said that the Building Microservices book is the "DDD: The good parts" version of the Domain Driven Design book of Eric Evans (please note that none of these book have I read yet :smile:). 
<!-- --- I tend to remember statements like that because it it a comparison between two famous books, and to be economical ... and I prefer reading a smaller book than a large one, and I prefer buying a cheaper one, and a more recently published one. ---  -->
That statement, later on, I interpreted it to mean that _microservices are the same as bounded contexts_.

But a few days ago, as I was watching an interview of Uncle Bob Martin --- ["A Path to Better Programming • Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin & Allen Holub • GOTO 2021"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnmRpHFoYLk&t=747s&ab_channel=GOTOConferences) --- the interviewer, Allen Holub, made a statement which implies that microservices are not the same as bounded contexts! <small>(in time 5:00 in the video)</small>


_--- Of all the good things in that video, this is the one you remember most? ---_


Uhuh!


I don't really know that much about microservices or bounded contexts. But because microservices seems hyped these days, those words coming out from master programmers, who have lots of skills and experience in software development, are very valuable --- needs to be put in storage for future reference.
