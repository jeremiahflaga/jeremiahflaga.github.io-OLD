... because they do not seem to have this **inside information** that C.S. Lewis talked about.


> There is one thing, and only one, in the whole universe which we know more about than we could learn from external observation. That one thing is Man. We do not merely observe men, we are men. In this case we have, so to speak, inside information; we are in the know. And because of that, we know that...

How is it like to be a human?

**Some** of our media people do not seem to know how to be human. They look like us, but they do not seem to behave like us.

Some of them are not afraid to go to _dangerous_ places where they might be infected by this recent virus. That is very different from 








Some of them are 100% healthy, with no sickness or virus in their bodies whatsoever. So they assume that we, humans, who look like them, are also 100% healthy


They assume that being human means being 100% healthy, like them; with no sickness or virus in our body whatsoever. 

And so they bombard us with information about this recent virus so that we know how to protect ourselves; because if we don't protect ourselves and we die, who are going to watch their shows on the television? No one. And if no one watches their shows on the television, where will they get their pay?

They assume that humans are preoccupied with thinking only about our health, and none else.

Some of them even assume that everyone is only thinking about how to live, instead of how to not-live, every millisecond of their lives. :laughing:

Maybe some of them assume that being human means living in this material universe forever.

But here's a more interesting truth: Their definition for human is much much worse than those mentioned above: Being human means having a negative result for a particular kind of test. 

If you have a positive result for that particular test, that means that you are going to die, and so are not human, because humans live forever (some of them assume). So they will put you in isolation, until they can be sure that you really are a human being. If you do not die in isolation then they can be sure that you are a human being.

See that!? Humans say that "no man is an island". These aliens from outer space do not completely know what that means because they do not have this _inside information_ about what being human actually is.

Maybe they have never experienced being isolated and so they do not know what being isolated feels like.

Or maybe they have experienced being isolated, but becuase they are aliens from outer space they have a different kind of isolation experience than we, mere human beings, do experience.

Or maybe they were isolated like that before by other aliens from other places in the outer space, and so they want revenge. They can't make their revenge with those aliens becuse they are more powerful than them, so they are making their revenge on us, mere human beings, because we are less powerful than those aliens who isolated them before.

They are allowed to roam around because viruses cannot be transmitted to them or through them, because they have a different biology than us humans.
