**NOTE: This is a work in progress --- the reason why the date is Jan 2, 0001.** :smile:


**Here are some ideas which dramatically changed the way I think at some point in the past, and which greatly influences the way I think today:**

## On Programming

### These programming frameworks and libraries and languages popping up from everywhere every millisecond of the day are not the primary things that will save us from the troubles ahead

["This Is How We Do It"](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2015/10/25/A0B2606228759D1A888E0AFFDB9DADE0.html) by Terence McGhee

> "**The key to growing in this occupation is to realize that neither the languages that you love or the frameworks that you’re familiar with are the keys to your success.** Because the field is so new and because the core fundamentals of programming today are almost exactly what they were from the beginning (Sequence, Selection, and Iteration), **your ability to advance is not hinged on language particulars or framework features**." 


["A Little Architecture"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html) by Uncle Bob Martin

> "The important decisions that a Software Architect makes are the ones that allow you to **NOT** make the decisions about the database, and the webserver, and the frameworks."

### Writing software has not significantly changed for many decades

["Staying relevant as a programmer"](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43) by Mattias Petter Johansson or MPJ

> "Are we forever cursed to do this constant tooling rodeo, where we try to hold on in the job market for dear life, learning new tools as the plop up all over the place?
<br /><br />
"Instead of trying to predict the future, which we humans are really bad at — just look at sci-fi movies from the 60-ies — **you should learn the stuff that doesn’t change around a lot**.
<br /><br />
"Learn the fundamentals that we figured out in the 70s and that have been true since. Learn programming in *general*. Don’t be better Angular programmer, or even a better JavaScript programmer — just be a better programmer, period."


["Three Paradigms"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/12/19/Three-Paradigms.html) by Uncle Bob Martin

> ...**But in that same 40 years software technology has barely changed at all.** After all, we still write the same if statements, while loops, and assignment statements we did back in the ’60s. If I took a programmer from 1960 and brought him forward through time to sit at my laptop and write code; he’d need 24 hours to recover from the shock; but then he’ll be able to write the code. **The concepts haven’t changed that much.**



["This Is How We Do It"](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2015/10/25/A0B2606228759D1A888E0AFFDB9DADE0.html) by Terence McGhee

> "If you haven’t been programming for at least 20 years or more, then it might be tough for you to understand how little the actual nuts and bolts of programming have evolved in the last 60 years. Every program can still be boiled down to the basics of structured programming that Dijsktra was preaching since the early 1970’s: Sequence, Selection, and Iteration."

### Focus your learning on those stuffs which have been proven useful,

<h2 id="learning-philosophy">
    <strong>My learning philosophy today on software development</strong>
</h2>

When I started coding, my focus on learning was trying to master the specifics of a programming language.

Then a few years later, my focus moved into trying to master specific frameworks and libraries.

But then I heard Uncle Bob Martin saying that software development has not changed in the last 40 years. And I heard Mattias Petter Johansson's [advise for programmers:](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)

> "... **learn the stuff that doesn’t change around a lot**. Learn the fundamentals that we figured out in the 70s and that have been true since. Learn programming in **general**. Don’t be a better Angular programmer, or even a better JavaScript programmer — just be a better programmer, period."

So today, my focus moved into learning the basic principles of software design and methodologies, because these are the things that do not change a lot, and these things will help me make software that is [highly maintainable](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2016/10/15/551B3828CD47198C7C5A58903228DA71.html), which many master programmers say is the primary value of software for customers (and for the programmers also).

<!-- 
Many years ago, I heard/read someone say that the maintenance phase is the most expensive phase of a software system.
 -->

Today, my learning philosophy is like this:

> [Just-in-time learning](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2014/06/23/dont-overwhelm-trying-learn-much/) about specific languages and frameworks and libraries

> Ahead-of-time learning about basic principles and practices in software development, and about [programming in general](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)

For example, there was a time when I was trying to learn AngularJS (version 1) because it was the frontend technology that is being used in my new job _(just-in-time learning of specific frameworks)_. Then on the side, I was consuming ["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Refactoring-Martin-Fowler/9780201485677?a_aid=jflaga) of Martin Fowler _(ahead-of-time learning of general concepts.)_

## On Christianity

### ["Mere Christianity"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Mere-Christianity-C-S-Lewis/9780007461219?a_aid=jflaga) by C.S. Lewis
