> **"The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed."** - Peter Block (through Woody Zuill in the beginning of his [talk on "Mob Programming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLEsWB1wZMA))

<small>NOTE: Many of my readings here are what [Mortimer Adler](https://www.bookdepository.com/How-Read-Book-Mortimer-J-Adler/9781476790152?a_aid=jflaga) calls _Inspectional Reading_ . You cannot expect me to have already _mastered_ all the materials presented in the books listed below. I will have to reread them (or even apply them consistently in my life or at work) to master them. :smile: </small>

#### ["Mere Christianity"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Mere-Christianity-C-S-Lewis/9780007461219?a_aid=jflaga) by C.S. Lewis

<small><small>
_(2nd reading: Dec 22, 2019 - Jan 12, 2020)_
</small></small> 

<small><small>
_(3rd reading of books 1 and 2: Apr-Jun 2020)_
</small></small>

One of the greatest books ever written! **You have to read this book!** 

If you are a Christian, you will be reminded of what you believe. C.S. Lewis himself said in the book that _"We have to be continually reminded of what we believe. Neither this belief nor any other will automatically remain alive in the mind. It must be fed"_. 

If you are not a Christian, this book will help you understand what Christianity is all about, and what Christians believe.

<!-- 
Not sure yet, but information like this might lead to the understanding of why the people witnessing Jesus multiplying bread and fish did _not_ seem _shocked_ by that miracle. I mean, the records in the gospels seems to indicate, at least to me, that that miracle just looks normal to them :blush:. Or perhaps I should not use the word _normal_ --- the record seems to suggest that that miracle do not look very extraordinary to them.

Not sure yet, but it seems to me that the multiplication of bread is more extraordinary than the healing of the blind man or even the resurrection from the dead! But why were the people not shocked by that miracle? Why did they still kill him when he can create food out of nothing!? Is creating food out of nothing a common sight to behold during their time?
