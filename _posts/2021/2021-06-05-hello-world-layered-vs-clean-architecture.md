A few weeks ago, I read [an article](https://xianminx.github.io/2013/02/28/computer-system-a-programmer-perspective/) which says this:

> the best way to learn a field is to know the overall structure, but not many single isolated points

Bird's eye view

One of the things -- my mind -- preoccupied with since the beginning of my  programming is how to best structure a software system -- is software architecture.



I'm going to write a few blog post on the simplest possible example of Layers architecture and clean architecture I can think of, and then compare them and point out the differences between them.


But who knows, these posts might someday help a poor young soul who is trying to understand Clean Architecture.






One of the things I have observed about life so far is that people can have more courage or patience to deal with evil if they have a clear picture of what good looks like.

	As a corollary: people will know what things to avoid doing what they know is evil, but they will have no direction to go if evil is all they know. They will only have direction if they know what is good.
	
	... So even if people do not know evil, and they only know good, --- it is more advatageous because first is that they have direction, and second is that they 
	
	
		If one knows what evil is, he knows what to avoid, but he does not know where to go.
		But if one knows what is good,  he has an idea on what to avoid (avoid whatever that do not look like good), and he also has a direction; he knows where to go.
		
		(There's another thing: it seems to me that knowing what is good does not necessarily make one want to do what is good, or it does not make one move towards the direction of goodness.)


	(I'm not saying that I know what good is.. But there was someone who claimed to be Truth, and who also said that only God is good. If he was right, then...)






Uncle Bob gave this diagram as an example of how to implement a Clean Architecture
