I'm not yet sure about the truthfulnes of the things written in this post, but writing helps in the development of ideas, so i'm going to write them anyway and publish them (because publishing what I write is my only motivation to write things, for now)


Why do software developers like to design things? - what you want to say here is that we want our designs to be the one used in the system because we think that we know better -- I'm guilty of this myself


Because Fred Brooks said:

Maybe not.

Maybe the reason is because programming is an intellectual kind of work and and we want to use our knowledge to design things


(Just like the temptation of intellectuals in the real world, they want to design things instead of trusting what others have observed as the invisible hand.)

Maybe this is just how things work:
	
Things start as chaotic

Then there is some kind of good tyranny

The tyranny has golden age

Then the good tyrants were replaced by bad tyrants (because like what C.S Lewis says: the evil goes to the top then things break)

The tyranny falls

Back to chaos

One solution might be to keep a separate copy of the project but with minimal features, where someone with design ideas can practice implementing his ideas there
