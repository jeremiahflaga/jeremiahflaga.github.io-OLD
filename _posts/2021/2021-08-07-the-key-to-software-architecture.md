> **Software architecture is the art of drawing lines that I call boundaries.** Those boundaries separate software elements from one another, and restrict those on one side from knowing about those on the other. Some of those lines are drawn very early in a project’s life—even before any code is written. Others are drawn much later. Those that are drawn early are drawn for the purposes of deferring decisions for as long as possible, and of keeping those decisions from polluting the core business logic.

I have also blogged about this a few years ago, [here](/2017/09/07/architecture-is-the-art-of-drawing-lines/).

But of course, knowledge is only potential power, so... sad life... but at least now we _can_ have a direction...

## P.S.

In the video ["Architecture without Architects" by Erik Dörnenburg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVyt3qQ_7TA&ab_channel=FooCafe), it was suggested that "Town Planning" or "Gardening" are better metaphors than "Architecture" for this activity in software we now refer to as "architecture"
