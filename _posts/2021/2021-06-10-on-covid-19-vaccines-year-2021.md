<!-- June 9-10, 2021  Philippine Time -->

During the early days of the pandemic (**April 2020**), Dr. John Ioannidis gave this caution about corona vaccines in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwPqmLoZA4s&ab_channel=JourneymanPictures?t=2100):

> I would like to be optimistic that we should be able to regain much of our functional life before vaccine becomes available, if ever a vaccine becomes available because, as we discussed, there is all these caveats about the ability to get a vaccine done and get it out there in massive production.
>
> ... Vaccines are one of the greatest contributions of science to the humans. There are great success stories. We have several vaccines that are wonderful success stories. This doesn't mean that necessarily we will have a success story with the vaccine for corona virus. We have some experience from the past, from efforts to develop vaccines for the other corona viruses that we were aware, and they were not very successful.
>
> One concerning observation is that in some cases vaccines were developed for animal models of corona viruses because we have corona viruses that infect cats and other animals, and they caused more damage than not giving them at all, because they led to a hypersensitivity response. So when the animal was exposed to the corona virus it overreacted to the virus. And that actually could even lead to death and worse outcome compared to not having been vaccinated at all.
> 
> We need to understand what is the exact mechanism that is leading to severe outcome in humans and death, and **we need to understand whether it is the virus itself, or is it the immune response to the virus that is doing more damage in different cases**. If it is the virus, and the problem is that we don't get enough of an immune response, then we need to have a vaccine. **If the problem is that it's the overreaction of our immune system, that eventually leads to accidentally to destroying our own cells like lung cells, then a vaccine may actually be a bad idea.** Bottom line: a vaccine needs to be very thoroughly tested. We need to have solid evidence that it works, solid evidence that it makes things better, solid evidence that it will save lives. And this cannot be done overnight.
>
> I wish that we could do it very fast, and I want to see these studies done, and I know that lots of brilliant scientists are working on this front, and I want to remain optimistic. But it's unlikely that we will be able to wait for 12 or 18 or 24 months to get a vaccine, and even more so under such uncertainty. I don't think that we can remain in lockdown states for so long and not just destroy ourselves, destroy our communities, destroy our societies, create huge problems for health, for unemployment, for out economy, for our society, that are much worse than even the worst and most pessimistic scenario of what corona virus can do.

A few days ago (**June 2021**) I heard this from Dr. Pierre Kory, in his [interview with Bret Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn_b4NRTB6k&ab_channel=BretWeinstein):

> What was recognized early on is that it was a disease of phases. So it started out as a general viral syndrome --- most people recovered, self-limited, it
was like a cold. Sometimes a little bit more severe than a cold.
>
But everyone quickly realized that around day five, seven, eight, there was a proportion of patients who suddenly started dropping their oxygen levels, and basically their lungs were inflamed. And we now know that it's a cell called a macrophage, which gets activated and literally attacks the lungs. And so you have this sort of immune response that is attacking the lungs, and the lungs start to fail... It causes a lot of inflammation, and so that inflammation injures the lung.And so you could see the lungs starting not to work and so it's predominantly a severe lung disease. 
>
> And what I will never forget in my life is those early months because (and i'm going to go back to that steroid thing) we saw patients just this disease
marching straight to the ventilator, and so many people were landing on ventilators. And you remember people were running out of ventilators and there was two reasons for that. One is because the entire health care community, globally, said this is a viral disease so supportive care only --- you're talking about tylenol
and fluids. And as they did supportive care only --- because there was no randomized controlled trials... like, everyone talks about evidence based, I'm always like what about experience based medicine; I've been doing this for 30 years why can't I do what my experience tells me to do. I don't have randomized controlled trials, but to do nothing was leading to ventilator shortages...

> ... **It's incorrect to say that they were dying of the virus.** We knew relatively early on by the time they get to the ICU, and they're that sick, there's not a lot of viral replication going on. In fact you can't culture virus after about day seven or eight. **And so it's actually disease of inflammation, not viral invasion.** In fact in autopsy series only 20 percent do they find what's called cytopathic changes from the virus into the lung. And so you didn't have to go after the virus at that point. You had to actually check the inflammation.

I don't really know some of the terminologies used in those statements --- tylenol, cytopathic changes, etc. But considering only those statments that we, laypeople, can understand, and analyzing them, what do you hear them saying?

<small>
If I understood those statements correctly, they seem to sound like "if ones immune system is able to handle the vaccine it would have been able to handle the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself". Not sure, but that's how they sound to me. :smiley: _(I heard that I can say anything on the internets as long as there is a smiley at the end.)_ Lots of smiley for you; please don't be angry with me. :smiley: :smiley: :smiley:
