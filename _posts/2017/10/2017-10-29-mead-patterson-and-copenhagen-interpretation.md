_Copenhagen Interpretation?_

_Big words!_

_What is that?_


I don't really know :laughing:

All I know is that it results to this very absurd notion that something can be in two different states at the same time.

That does not match with a very fundamental principle in logic --- the law of non-contradiction.

I first heard about this idea of _"something being in two different states at the same time"_ a few years ago, in a video of Ray Comfort where he interviews people, asking them questions, and then sharing the gospel to them.

In that video (I'm not sure if I can still locate it), Ray Comfort was talking about logic. At the end part of that video, the person being interviewed talked about an example where the law of non-contradiction does not apply --- the Schrodinger's Cat.

I googled about it of course!

I found out that it is related to this "quantum" thing, which I also know nothing about. :laughing:

But I heard someone in the past who compared this "quantum" thing to "magic".

So I dismissed the Schrodinger's Cat example as something I do not have to worry about.

The law of non-contradiction is saved! Yehey!

Wheh!

Then a few months ago, I learned (or relearned?), through Wikipedia, that this Schrodinger's Cat thing was actually a thought experiment given by someone named Schrodinger to show the **absurdity** of what is known as the "Copenhagen Interpretation" of a phenomena being observed by physicists in a very fundamental level of our physical world.

It was not supposed to provide an example of _"something being in two different states at the same time."_
