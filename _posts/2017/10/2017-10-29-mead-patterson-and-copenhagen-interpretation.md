_Copenhagen Interpretation?_

_Big words!_

_What is that?_


I don't really know :laughing:

All I know is that it results to this very absurd notion that something can be in two different states at the same time.

That does not match with a very fundamental principle in logic --- the law of non-contradiction.

> It is not possible to have both A and not-A at the same time and in the same sense.

I first heard about this idea of _"something being in two different states at the same time"_ a few years ago, in a video of Ray Comfort where he interviews someone, asking him questions, and then sharing the gospel to him.

In that video (I'm not sure if I can still locate it), Ray Comfort was talking about logic. At the end part of that video, the person being interviewed talked about an example where the law of non-contradiction does not apply --- the Schrodinger's Cat.

I googled about it of course!

I found out that it is related to this "quantum" thing, which I also know nothing about. :laughing:

But I heard someone in the past who compared this "quantum" thing to "magic".

So I dismissed the Schrodinger's Cat example as something I do not have to worry about.

The law of non-contradiction is saved! Yehey!

Whew!

Then a few months ago, I learned (or relearned?), through Wikipedia, that this "Schrodinger's Cat" thing was actually a thought experiment given by someone named Schrodinger to show the **absurdity** of what is known as the "Copenhagen Interpretation" of a phenomenon being observed by physicists in a fundamental level of our physical world.

The "Schrodinger's Cat" thing was not supposed to provide an example of _"something being in two different states at the same time!"_

Then a few months later, I found an article listed in [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) which captured my interest: ["How Non-Scientists Think About Science and Science Denial".](https://blogs.harvard.edu/philg/2017/06/28/how-non-scientists-think-about-science-and-science-denial/)

I usually read the comments of the articles that I read... I found a very interesting comment by someone named _"billg"_:

> There was great interview of Dr. Carver Mead (google him, he contributed a lot to microelectronics) where he argues that what becomes science orthodoxy is actually very political. He goes on to say the last [70] year[s] of physics has gone in the wrong direction due to “political census”...

Politics!... in science!?...

So what does [Dr. Carver Mead say](http://worrydream.com/refs/Mead%20-%20American%20Spectator%20Interview.html) about this "Schrodinger's Cat" thing and this "Copenhagen Interpretation"?

> ... But Schrodinger thought that a continuum theory of the electron could be successful. So he went to Copenhagen to work with Bohr. He felt that it was a matter of getting a "political" consensus; you know, this is a historic thing that is happening. But whenever Schrodinger tried to talk, Bohr would raise his voice and bring up all these counter-examples. Basically he shouted him down.
<br /><br />
> ... Of course. _It was a period when physics was full of huge egos._ It was still going on when I got into the field. But it doesn't make sense, and it isn't the way science works in the long run. It may forestall people from doing sensible work for a long time, which is what happened. _They ended up derailing conceptual physics for the next 70 years._

Wow!
