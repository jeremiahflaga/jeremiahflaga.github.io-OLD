**Update (February 11, 2020):**

I just learned that [sponges are considered animals](https://www.quora.com/Are-sponges-considered-animals-or-plants-Why) even though they do not move. Because of that, my definition for _animal_ below falls apart. (Please do not read this post. You will just be wasting your time if you do.) 

Also C.S. Lewis, a new addition to my list of heroes, referred to people as _animals_ in his book [_Mere Christianity_](https://www.bookdepository.com/Mere-Christianity-C-S-Lewis/9780007461219?a_aid=jflaga).

I can now somewhat accept that people be classified as animals, with a strong note of course that people are not _just_ animals. We might be classified as animals but being an animal is just a subset of what we are.

I was taught, when I was a child, that people are special beings. That they are different from animals. By _animals_ I mean cats, dogs, cows... You know what I mean. :smile:

Why would some professors at MIT categorize people as animals?

## Are they calling people as animals at MIT?
-->

For instance, at about 21:00 minutes in the video of Lecture 9 of [MIT OCW's course #6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/), the lecturer, a beautiful and intelligent lady, categorizes people as _"animals"_.

(I am learning a lot from these lectures. But this _"animal"_ thing is not CS-related, so I believe I am allowed to comment on this. :smile: I might sound stupid below, but bear with me till the end.)

**Ahh!** Maybe they have a different **definition** for _"animal"_ than I do.

Maybe their definition for _"animal"_ is 

> _"any living thing that is not a **plant**"._

Maybe not... A _bacteria_ will be considered as an animal by that definition. 

Maybe their definition for animal is 

> _"any living thing that is not a **plant** and is not a **bacteria**"._

Are viruses different from bacteria?

I don't know. But if they are, I have to change the definition... An animal is 

> _"any living thing that is not a **plant** and is not a **bacteria** and is not a **virus**"._

Are insects animals too? I'm not sure. If they are not, then I have to modify the definition a bit... An animal is 

> _"any living thing that is not a **plant** and is not a **bacteria** and is not a **virus** and is not an **insect**"._

Are angels animals also?

Wait, wait, wait! Are angels even allowed in this discussion?

Okay, let's exclude angels in this discussion.

But if we don't consider bacteria and viruses as animals because they are very **different** from what we know as _animals_ (like cats, dogs, and rabbits) why should we classify ourselves (people) as _animals_ when we **_know_** that we are very **different** from cats and dogs and rabbits?

We _know_?

Hmmm...

Wait...

Perhaps we can make our definition much simpler, to make the **difference** between us and bacteria very clear.

Okay, let's start from the beginning...

What about we define "animal" as

> _"anything that has life"_.

That will make our lives easier. Right?

But _plants_ are **_clearly_** not _animals!_ They are very different from what we think of as animals!

**_Clearly?_** _Clear_ is very subjective. What is clear to you might not be clear to others. What's clear today might not be clear tomorrow!

But... for now, we will just follow what we think is _clear_ today. 

<!--
But we can't just define things by what is _clear_, right?. What is _clear_ to you might not be _clear_ to me. Plants have age, and they can have names. Certainly they can be classified as animals.
-->

Okay... An animal is

> _"any living thing that is not a **plant**"_.

<small>(What is a _plant_?)</small>

That should be our last attempt of defining _"animal"_, right? --- Perhaps we can convince everyone that bacteria are animals also!? They are very tiny, but they can move, like cats can move!

But when we hear the word _"animal"_, what we are thinking of is something that can be seen by our naked eye!

Bacteria cannot be seen with the naked eye! Viruses too!

... Ahh!... I think I get it already.

Perhaps the definition for _"animal"_ is

> **any living thing that can move and can be seen with the naked eye.**

But whose eye? Do bacteria have eyes too?

Hmmm...

Okay, let's stop talking about _bacteria eyes_ here. :smile:

What about _angel eyes_? Angels have eyes, right?

Angels are excluded in this discussion!... Okay...

That latest definition is clearer than the previous ones, I believe.

An animal is 

> **any living thing that can move and can be seen with the naked eye.**

So we have to change things a bit here. Bacteria and viruses are not animals now. Let's call them the **invisible-animals**... I mean, not animals... the **invisibles**... **invisible-tiny-things**.

Insects will be classified as animals, by that definition.

Angels are... well... not animals. :smile:

(Why do you keep mentioning angels!)

We, humans, by that definition, are animals too!

Alright! Good!

But... Wait...

Are we, humans, the final authority for defining things?

We want to think that we are, of course! But are we?

<!-- _Of course not!_

Of course we _know_ that we are not the final authority for defining things!  -->

But who else is there? We are the only ones in here. So we have to define things for ourselves!

But... are we the only ones in here?

<small>
(**Hint:** The Christian [worldview](http://www.jasonlisle.com/2013/09/06/are-you-epistemologically-self-conscious/) _says_ that we _know_ that we are not the final authority for defining things, and that we _know_ that we are not the only ones in here, and that we are doing our best to suppress that knowledge. Scary right!? But the good thing is that it helps us to be ready about the future.)
