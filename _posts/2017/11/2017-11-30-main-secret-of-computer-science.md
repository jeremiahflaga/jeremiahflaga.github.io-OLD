Do you like simple rules?

Me too!

I like simple, but all-encompassing rules _(partly because I'm not very good at remembering lots of things :) ):_

> "Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler." - Albert Einstein
	
> If it is hard, it might/must be wrong.

I found another one simple rule!

In the introductory videos of the Nand2Tetris course, Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken calls it _"The Main Secret of Computer Science"_

> Don't worry about the **"how"**, only about the **"what"**.
<br /><br />
> In other words: Don't worry about the **implementation**, only about the **abstraction**.
