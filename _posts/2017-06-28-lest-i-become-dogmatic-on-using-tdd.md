While reading [an article about TDD](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/outside-in-development-with-double-loop-tdd/), and googling for Steve Freeman's blog, I came across this blog post of Johannes Link: ["Say Goodbye: I won't be back"](http://blog.johanneslink.net/2011/12/02/say-goodbye-i-wont-be-back/)

He said,

> "People or process" can -- and often should -- mean: not doing an agile transition at all. Human beings..."

Ouch! :sob:

Too bad... because I have this plan on writing a post with the title _"How to save ourselves from the wrath of future programmers"_, where I will be _(dogmatically?) suggesting_ :laughing: the use of TDD.

But... Johannes Link has a point...

Should we force a team to do TDD when they are not _yet_ familiar with it? 

Of course not! That would cause a disaster... a hatred for TDD. 

Very bad.

Should we force someone to pair program when he is not comfortable about doing it?

Should we force an _impatient_ developer to review code written by a beginning programmer?

_These_ good practices does not always work for everyone everytime everywhere :smile:.

So, lest I become dogmatic on using TDD and other great software development practices, I'm going to post here some good quotes which will serve as a reminder for my future self not to be dogmatic on things I should not be dogmatic about.




## Quotes

**Steve Freeman** in an interview:

> Q: Are there situations in which you consider TDD not to be the right approach for developing software? If so...





**Ralph Westphal** in a comment:

> If the "core philosphy" is "agile methods fundamentally expect teams to decide what process to follow and furthermore expect teams to actively and regularly change their process", then that's nothing more than **inspect & adapt**, which of course is a core technique for any conscious being, I'd say. So nothing special about agility...





[**Woody Zuill** in his talk on Mob Programming](link to youtube video here):

> ... I want to make it real clear. I'm talking about something that a team that I worked with experiences.
<br /><br />
> **"The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed."** - Peter Block
<br /><br />
> I'm not telling you how to do something or whether you should do it. I'm sharing with you how we did something and how it worked for us. And if you think you're going to do it... what you will learn today... great! And I'd love to hear back from you, your experiences, because I'm going to learn from that.

## Tapping myself in the back

But to tap myself in the back, I think I am not _that_ prone to being dogmatic on the use of _these_ software development practices or disciplines... because I remember having this statement in my resume a while back:

> I believe in **"discarding practices that does not work in a particular team and retaining those that work"**.

## And...

Also, I am influenced by Greg Howlett with this _philosophy_ in music: _**"if it sounds good, it is good", (even when we can't [yet] explain why)**_.

Also, I am influenced with the idea of _Christian liberty_, which says something like _**"there are things that are not clear in the Bible --- we should not be dogmatic about them"**_

And... Oh... Maybe you will agree with me that this very post is evidence that I am not _that_ dogmatic! :innocent: :smile:
