While reading [an article about TDD](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/outside-in-development-with-double-loop-tdd/), and googling for [Steve Freeman](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga)'s blog, I came across this blog post: ["Say Goodbye: I won't be back"](http://blog.johanneslink.net/2011/12/02/say-goodbye-i-wont-be-back/)

The author said,

> "People or process" can --- and often should --- mean: not doing an agile transition at all. Human beings..."

That hurts! :laughing: :sob:

Too bad... because I have this plan of writing a post with the title _"How to save ourselves from the wrath of future programmers"_, where I will be _dogmatically(?) suggesting_ :laughing: the use of TDD.

But... the author of that post has a point...

Should we _force_ a team to do TDD when they are not _yet_ familiar with it? --- When they are not _yet_ confident about using it?

Of course not! I believe that that will cause a disaster --- a hatred for TDD; a hatred towards those who promote TDD.

Very bad.

Should we _force_ someone to pair program when he is not comfortable about doing it? Of course not.

Should we _force_ someone to hand over his code for review when he does not like the idea of being reviewed?

Ummmm... I don't know. :smile: 

Of course we can do this _forcing_ thing if they agreed to it in the first place.



Like what Woody Zuill said, **_"The people doing the work can best determine how to do that work"_**

_These_ good practices does not always work for everyone everytime everywhere :smile:.

So, lest I become dogmatic on using TDD and on other great software development practices that our _masters_ are promoting, I'm going to post here some good quotes which will serve as a reminder for my future self not to be dogmatic on things I should not be dogmatic of.




## Quotes

**Steve Freeman** in an interview:

> Q: Are there situations in which you consider TDD not to be the right approach for developing software? If so...





**Ralph Westphal** in a comment:

> If the "core philosphy" is "agile methods fundamentally expect teams to decide what process to follow and furthermore expect teams to actively and regularly change their process", then that's nothing more than **inspect & adapt**, which of course is a core technique for any conscious being, I'd say. So nothing special about agility...





[**Woody Zuill** in his talk on Mob Programming](link to youtube video here):

> ... I want to make it real clear. I'm talking about something that a team that I worked with experiences.
<br /><br />
> **"The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed."** - Peter Block
<br /><br />
> I'm not telling you how to do something or whether you should do it. I'm sharing with you how we did something and how it worked for us. And if you think you're going to do it... what you will learn today... great! And I'd love to hear back from you, your experiences, because I'm going to learn from that.

## Tapping myself in the back

But to tap myself in the back, I think I am not _that_ prone to being dogmatic on the use of _these_ software development practices or disciplines... because I remember having this statement in my resume a while back:

> I believe in **"discarding practices that does not work in a particular team and retaining those that work"**.

## And...

Also, I am influenced by Greg Howlett with this _philosophy_ in music: _**"if it sounds good, it is good", (even when we can't [yet] explain why)**_.

Also, I am influenced with the idea of _Christian liberty_, which says something like _**"there are things that are not clear in the Bible --- we should not be dogmatic about them".**_ Christians are sometimes ridiculed for being dogmatic on many things, most especially on the _existence of the Biblical God_ :laughing:, but Christians also know that there are many things that we cannot know for sure in this life, such as _"why evil exists"_. (But if we reject Christianity only because we cannot have a _sure_ answer to the _problem of evil_, we first have to think about _where_ we got this idea of _"evil"_, or _why_ we have this idea of _"evil"_. --- What is _"evil"?_.)

And... Oh... Maybe you will agree with me that this very post is evidence that I am not _that_ dogmatic! :innocent: :smile:

But I'm still going to write that post
