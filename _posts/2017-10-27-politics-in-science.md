I'm not a scientist. I only learned a bit about how things work in the world of science through Dr. Werner Gitt's talk titled "In the Beginning was Information".

But I read someone in the past who said that when we, normal (non-scientist) people, hear the word scientist, what we have in mind is someone wearing a lab gown, experimenting with things in a neutral fashion and presenting the results of those experiments when they are done. Then the author went on to say that that is not always the case.

Scientists, also, have their own personal biases. And their biases affects how they present the conclusion of their experiments. (I think it even affects the decision of whether or not they will present their conclusions at all :smile: )


So I am very interested when people talk about something like "science says this" or "science says that" because I know that science cannot say anything; it's the scientist(s) that says things; and the worldview of the scientist(s) will affect how they say (interpret) the things that they observe. 

Maybe you know what happened to Galileo
