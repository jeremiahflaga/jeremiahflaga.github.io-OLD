I just read from Colossians 3 that "Love is what holds everything together in perfect unity."

Love is very powerful, I believe. I even thought to myself in the past that love is the most powerful force in the entire universe --- it can change anything.

But how to love? That is my question.

<!--more-->

Can we do the _"act the way you want to feel"_ method on this?

That sounds pretentious to me. :laughing:

But what I mean is, "can we _discipline_ ourselves to love?"

Maybe??

Love is a choice, right? (Paul says, _"put on_ love")

But, is there an easier method? :smile:

**PS:**

I believe that the enemy of our Creator has been redefining _terms_ since his rebellion. He sometimes uses the media to redefine terms.

If you think you have been _greatly_ influenced by the secular media in the past many years, please note that your definition of the word _love_ might be different from my definition when I use that word above.

If you have no idea what I mean by _love_, please read I Corinthians 13 of the bible. It was also written by Paul. :smile:
