Can you believe that?

An author of a book, [TDD with Python,](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book) which is also freely available online, considers his formal CS education as bad.

> A couple more of those lovely f-strings in this listing! If they’re still a bit of a mystery, take a look at the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings), (although if your formal CS education is as bad as mine, you’ll probably skip the formal grammar).
	
That is taken from [Chapter 7: Working Incrementally](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_working_incrementally.html) (retrieved last June 27, 2017)

If he calls his formal CS education "bad", much more can I call mine as bad, because I _know_ :grin: it was much worse than his. :laughing:

But of course, things change... people change. I hope we are living in a period where things are changing for the better. :smile:
