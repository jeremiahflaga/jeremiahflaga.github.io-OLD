I've been consuming a few Jordan Peterson videos lately. And this led me to this very very interesting, enlightening, and good [quote of his on free speech](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson):

> "I regard free speech as a prerequisite to a civilized society, because freedom of speech means that you can have combat with words. That's what it means. It doesn't mean that people can happily and gently exchange opinions. It means that we can engage in combat with words, in the battleground of ideas. And the reason that that's acceptable, and why it's acceptable that people's feelings get hurt during that combat, is that the combat of ideas is far preferable to actual combat."

He said that it's okay for our feelings to get hurt during this combat of words, because the alternative, which is actual combat, might kill you physically, which means you will not have time anymore to change your mind on things! Now, I see why there are some [criticisms to these so-called self-help books](https://albertmohler.com/2006/07/03/america-should-be-ashamed-of-sham-2/). I have read only a few self-help books but it seems to me that these books kind of teaches that offending other people through your words is _always_ a bad thing. Perhaps it's just me... I don't know...


**Here are more quotes from the some Jordan Peterson videos:**

### from ["Be Dangerous But Disciplined - Jocko Willink & Jordan Peterson"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4PS_DhzyDg)


> You don't make men safe by making them weak. If fact they are much more dangerous when they're weak because they will stab you in the back when they get a chance, or take advantage of you when they get the chance.
<br /><br />
You make men safe by making them strong and by making sure they are disciplined.

> It's the men that have the most "aggressive" and fearless temperaments that can be the best men but it's like having a very powerful dog. You better discipline it because otherwise it's going to be a monster.

> Unless you think the way that an evil person thinks then you're defenseless against them because they will go to places you cannot imagine and then they win.

> A harmless man is not a good man. A good man is a very dangerous man who has that under voluntary control.


### from ["The Importance of Having Thick Skin - Jocko Willink and Jordan Peterson"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=futHL4W4E4s)

> When a hundred people are teasing you then probably they are not wrong.

> ... You take away the joy of being so heated or irritated by the people who are making fun of you and you just kill it...


### from ["Sam Harris & Jordan Peterson - Vancouver - 1 (CC: Arabic & Spanish)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jey_CzIOfYE)



> <small>[40:30]</small> My point is that it isn't reasonable to take a single sentence out of a coherent narrative and say that stands on its own, or it's rarely reasonable because you have to interpret the words in the sentence and the sentence in the paragraph and the paragraph in the chapter and the chapter in the context of the entire book.

> <small>[54:30]</small> ... I can't see how you can interpret the world of facts without an a priori interpretive structure.
<br /><br />
... it is the claim of Kant for example that you can't get directly from the fact to the value because there's an interpretive framework that mediates between you and the fact.

> ... I think the nature of the interpretive framework is best understood at least in part as a personality or as a story for that matter.

### from ["Sam Harris & Jordan Peterson - Vancouver - 2 (CC: Arabic & Spanish)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf6X-FueMo)

> ... you cannot view the world without any a priori structure and that a priori structure has a dogmatic element and so you can't just say we'll just get rid of the dogma because you cannot perceive the world without a structure.
