Ooops!

I forgot that I'm supposed to be gathering quotes from books that I have been reading. 

... here are a few quotes from Simon Sinek's ["Start With Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone To Take Action"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Start-With-Why-Simon-Sinek/9780241958223?a_aid=jflaga):
 -->

> There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it.

> People don't but WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.

<!--more-->

> With a WHY clearly stated in an organization, anyone within the oranization can make a decision as clearly and as accurately as the founder. A WHY provides a clear filter for decision-making.

> "When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you."

> What if the next time when someone asks, "Who’s your competition?" we replied, "No idea." What if the next time someone pushes, "Well, what makes you better than your competition?" we replied, "We’re not better than them in all cases." And what if the next time someone asks, "Well why should I do business with you then?" we answer with confidence, "Because the work we’re doing now is better than the work we were doing six months ago. And the work we’ll be doing six months from now will be better than the work we’re doing today...


What are you waiting for... go ahead and buy the [book](https://www.bookdepository.com/Start-With-Why-Simon-Sinek/9780241958223?a_aid=jflaga)!

<!-- 
Some humor here... The book actually does not clearly define what _better_ is. _Better_ is implied in the examples in the book. But because you landed on this page, then I can assume that you, and I, and Simon Sinek, have somewhat similar ideas of what _better_ is... So what are you waiting for... go ahead and buy the book!

And here's something I'll leave you to think about: What is _better_?

<!-- I think what's better is that which approches the qualities of Jesus or God. Perhaps you can update this post later to point the reader to the gospel. -->
