Why Blog?

So that we will have something to laugh about when we get older, of course!

:laughing:

It's been a while since my last post. I do not yet know how to say the next things I want to say. So for now, here are some quotes about blogging (moved here from the [memorabilia section](/memorabilia/quotes/why-blog/) of this site):

### Vaughn Vernon has this to say to the question "Do you have any recommendations for newbie blog writers?" in the [comments section of one of his articles](https://web.archive.org/web/20180827140727/https://vaughnvernon.co/?p=879#comment-1938):

> "Write about what you are doing. When you face a tough problem in your work then you find a breakthrough, it’s probably something others will face. Blog about it." - Vaughn Vernon

### Sandro Mancuso (page 47 of ["The Software Craftsman"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Software-Craftsman-Sandro-Mancuso/9780134052502?a_aid=jflaga))

<small>(Chapter 4 is also published [here](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2273071&seqNum=2)</small>

> ... do not think that just experienced professionals should write blogs. All software developers should have their own blogs, regardless of how much experience they have. We should all share our experiences and findings and help to create a great community of professionals. Sometimes we may think that we are not good enough or do not have much to say. We may think that we don’t have an original idea and no one will read our blog anyway. 
<br /><br />
First of all, **we should treat our blog as a record of our own learning and progression — a history of our thoughts, ideas, and views of the world over our careers. We should not worry too much about what other people will think about it.** We should first write it for ourselves. Even if developers more experienced than us have written about the subject many times before, it is worth writing whatever we are currently learning anyway. Every year there are thousands of new developers joining our industry and they will need to learn many of the things we are learning now. **Maybe for them, our blogs will be very useful since we will be writing them from the perspective of a beginner.** 
<br /><br />
**Do not worry about being judged by more senior developers because that is not going to happen.** Whenever we Google for something and the first link we click leads to something we already know, we just jump to the next link. All developers should appreciate the effort that other developers make to write and share their views with the rest of the world, for free.



### John Sonmez (in ["Blogging for Software Developers"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/blogging-software-developers/))

> Aside from the external opportunities blogging offers you, it offers some great personal development opportunities as well.
<br /><br />
I don’t think there is any better way to improve your communication skills than writing.
<br /><br />
Writing teaches you to organize your thoughts clearly in a way that other people can understand.
<br /><br />
The more you write, the better of a communicator you’ll become in general.
<br /><br />
Blogging also helps you keep track of your own career and progress, as well as provides some historical documentation and reference material which you can look back on to see how you solved a particular problem in the past.

(I hope I will become a very good communicator :smile:)



### Robert C. Martin aka Uncle Bob (from ["I am Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). Ask me anything."](https://hashnode.com/post/i-am-robert-c-martin-uncle-bob-ask-me-anything-cjr7pnh8g000k2cs18o5nhulp))

> Q: What's the best non-code/non-technical thing someone can do to be a better programmer?
> A: Read and write. Read a lot and write a lot.



### William Lane Craig (in ["How to Cure Slow Thinking"](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/how-to-cure-slow-thinking1))

> "... write down your better responses so that they'll stick in your memory."



### Uncle Bob (in blog post ["Types and Tests"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/06/08/TestsAndTypes.html))

> "... debate with someone in the future by posting your refutation in the past."



### Isaac Morehouse (in ["Forward Tilt: An Almanac for personal growth"](https://discoverpraxis.com/forwardtilt-2/))

> Writing is one of the most important things you can become proficient at.
>
> The more your write, the better you get. The better you are, the better you can communicate ideas, build a network, and establish a presence.

> Don't worry about how it might sound to others. Fewer people read your stuff than you assume (no matter how famous you get!), and anyway, daily writing is for you, not them.

## Some quotes on writing

While googling for "I may never know until I read": 
-->

Cohen (quoted in the Preface of ["Economics in One Lesson"](https://fee.org/resources/economics-in-one-lesson/) by Henry Hazlitt)
