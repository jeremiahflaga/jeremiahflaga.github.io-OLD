<small>[This post is not my own answer to that question --- _"What is MVC, MVP, MVVM?..."_. This post just contains _a link_ to the **_best_** :grin: explanation there is about MVC, MVP and MVVM.]</small>

While searching my notes for [a blog post I read before about the _two ways_](https://craftsmanshipcounts.com/clean-architecture-a-tale-of-two-stories/) of how the "Use Cases/Interactors", "Presenters", and "Controllers" interact in an application employing the Clean Architecture model of structuring software projects, I found a [note](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/357052/clean-architecture-use-case-containing-the-presenter-or-returning-data) with this [image explaining MVC, MVP and MVVM](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y82D3.png)

It's from an [article written by Erwin Vandervalk.](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/erwinvandervalk/2009/08/14/the-difference-between-model-view-viewmodel-and-other-separated-presentation-patterns/)

One can clearly see the difference between _MVC_ and _MVP-(Passive View)_ and _MVP-(Supervising Controller)_ in that image. The _MVVM_ diagram looks like the _MVP-(Passive View)_ diagram, but you will see the difference if you read the [article]((https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/erwinvandervalk/2009/08/14/the-difference-between-model-view-viewmodel-and-other-separated-presentation-patterns/)).

The article also contains code samples which greatly helps programmers understand the patterns. :smile:

_Go on... Read it!..._

_Don't you think it is the best explanation of MVC, MVP, and MVVM? their similarities? and their differences?_

I think it is the best explanation.

I was searching a few weeks ago for a good explanation of MVC, MVP, and MVVM, but I was not able to find this article. It does not show up in search engine results _perhaps_ because its title does not contain the words "MVC" and "MVP". I hope this blog post will _help_ search engines find this [article by Erwin Vandervalk](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/erwinvandervalk/2009/08/14/the-difference-between-model-view-viewmodel-and-other-separated-presentation-patterns/) and include it in their top results.

Enjoy!
