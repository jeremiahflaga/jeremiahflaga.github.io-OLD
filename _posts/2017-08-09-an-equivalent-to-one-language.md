In one of Uncle Bob Martin's talks, he is suggesting that we, programmers, choose one or two programming languages that we can use to write code. (He was suggesting Clojure.)

But, at the end of the talk, he said that it might not happen today. Maybe in the future it will --- our children (read _future programmers_) might program using only one (or two) languages for (almost) everything.

But, having read his blog posts on Clean Architecture, and having heard his talks on it on youtube, I think we can still have an equivalent of a _one-language-on-everything_ experience during our lifetime.

I think that can happen if all programmers<sup id="footnote-indicator-1">[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup> and all IT/CS students (read _future programmers_) will become aware of this _Clean Architecture_ idea (or its equivalents: ports-and-adapters, hexagonal architecture, onion architecture, the boundary-controller-entity model)

When all programmers<sup id="footnote-indicator-1">[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup> will become aware of Clean Architecture... 

I believe we all will like it, because it has with it attached the promise of _control_ with our software projects!

Control!?

I think yes! Maybe not 100% control? I think the amount of control that a team can get from using the Clean Architecture depends on the people involved in the project.

So, I think, yes! Control... 

And if coupled with TDD... more control!!! :grin:

Okay, back to the _one language_ thing...

If students will be introduced to the Clean Architecture at school, and if industry practitioners implement their projects using the Clean Architecture, then programmers new to these projects will not be spending too much time getting familiar with the structure of a project, and can instead go directly to solving problems they were hired to solve.

We can also easily switch from one project to another, depending on where we are needed.

That experience would be like having only one language!

What do you think?

No?

But it could be _a step_ towards a _one (or two) programming language(s) world_.

<small>(I'm assuming here that a _one programming language world_ is a better world.)</small>

Then... maybe this awareness to the Clean Architecture idea will make our eyes opened to the other awareness --- that our main job as programmers is not to learn new frameworks or libraries that are popping up from everywhere everyday.

I think the main job of programmers is to make software that solves problems or can automate things while, at the same time, looking for ways to make that software easy to change. Software are called software because they are supposed to be easy to change, right? That's what Uncle Bob said in one of his talks.

I think that's where our focus should be --- making software that are easy to change.

Of course the frameworks and libraries are very very important also, but we should remember that the popular frameworks and libraries today might become obsolete.

Can we design our software systems so that it will be easy to replace frameworks or libraries when we already need better ones?
