the sound in my head when I cannot sleep a few days ago is the first bar in this sheet music:

<small>(I figured out later that the sheet music can be simplified if I use the 12-4 time signature, but it will take time for me to edit the sheet music. [Here's the MuseScore file](/files/music/2020-02-08-sound-of-i-cant-sleep.mscz) for you to edit if you want it to see it in 12-4.)</small>

**Update:**

That is not really the sound of "I can't sleep" :laughing:. I was just listening to [Chopin Nocturne Op. 9 No. 1 in B-flat Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myRTkyWejfo) while trying to get to sleep when I cannot sleep, then that sound popped in my mind.
