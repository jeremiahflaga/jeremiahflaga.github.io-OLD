I follow the satirical site [Babylon Bee on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheBabylonBee/). They had [this article regarding economics](https://babylonbee.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-economics-degree-recalled) which kind of recommends reading either _"Basic Economics" by Thomas Sowell or "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt_.


["Basic Economics"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Basic-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/9780465060733) is kind of costly :blush:, while "Economics in One Lesson" is available for free at the [Foundation for Economic Education's website](https://fee.org/resources/economics-in-one-lesson).

_Which one to read first?_

Of course the free one...

Here are some highlights from that book:



## Lesson learned:

It takes more than One hour to learn One Lesson



## More important notes:


> ... the whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can be reduced to a single sentence. **The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.**



> ... when we study the effects of various proposals, not merely on special groups in the short run, but on all groups in the long run, the conclusions we arrive at usually correspond with those of unsophisticated **common sense**.



> In the course of our study, also, we have rediscovered an old friend. He is **the Forgotten Man** of William Graham Sumner...:
>
> > As soon as A observes something which seems to him to be wrong, from which X is suffering, A talks it over with B, and A and B then propose to get a law passed to remedy the evil and help X. Their law always proposes to determine what C shall do for X or, in the better case, what A, B and C shall do for X. . . . What I want to do is to look up C. ... I call him the Forgotten Man. ... **He is the man who never is thought of.** He is the victim of the reformer, social speculator and philanthropist, and I hope to show you before I get through that he deserves your notice both for his character and for the many burdens which are laid upon him.



## Other notes:


> ... Therefore for every public job created by the bridge project a private job has been destroyed somewhere else. We can see the men employed on the bridge. We can watch them at work. The employment argument of the government spenders becomes vivid, and probably for most people convincing. But there are **other things that we do not see, because, alas, they have never been permitted to come into existence**.



> ... If taxes are taken from people and corporations, and spent in one particular section of the country, why should it cause surprise, why should it be regarded as a miracle, if that section **becomes comparatively richer**? Other sections of the country, we should remember, are then comparatively poorer. The thing so great that “private capital could not have built it” has in fact been built by private capital — the capital that was expropriated in taxes (or, if the money was borrowed, that eventually must be expropriated in taxes).



> A certain amount of taxes is of course indispensable to carry on essential government functions. Reasonable taxes for this purpose need not hurt production much.



> There is a strange idea abroad, held by all monetary cranks, that credit is something a banker gives to a man. **Credit, on the contrary, is something a man already has.** He has it, perhaps, because he already has marketable assets of a greater cash value than the loan for which he is asking. Or he has it because his character and past record have earned it. He brings it into the bank with him. That is why the banker makes him the loan. The banker is not giving something for nothing. He feels assured of repayment.



> ... Yet it is a misconception to think of the function or result of machines as primarily one of creating jobs. **The real result of the machine** is to increase production, to raise the standard of living, to increase economic welfare.



> In general Smith rested his case on one fundamental proposition: “In every country it always is and must be the interest of the great body of the people to buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest.”



> In order that new industries may grow fast enough it is necessary that some old industries should be allowed to shrink or die. They must do this in order to release the necessary capital and labor for the new industries. If we had tried to keep the horse-and-buggy trade artificially alive we should have slowed down the growth of the automobile industry and all the trades dependent on it. We should have lowered the production of wealth and retarded economic and scientific progress.



> **Prices are determined by supply and demand**, and demand is determined by how intensely people want a commodity and what they have to offer in exchange for it. It is true that supply is in part determined by costs of production. What a commodity has cost to produce in the past cannot determine its value. That will depend on the present relationship of supply and demand...



> ... To give farmers money for restricting production, or to give them the same amount of money for an artificially restricted production, is no different from forcing consumers or taxpayers to pay people for doing nothing at all.



> What lies at the base of the whole effort to fix maximum prices? There is first of all a misunderstanding of what it is that has been causing prices to rise. The real cause is either a scarcity of goods or a surplus of money.



> ... price-fixing discourages and disrupts employment and production



> **We cannot distribute more wealth than is created.** We cannot in the long run pay labor as a whole more than it produces.
> 
> The best way to raise wages, therefore, is to raise labor productivity. This can be done by many methods...



> Real wages come out of production, not out of government decrees.



> As to the prices, wages and profits that should determine the distribution of that product, the best prices are not the highest prices, but the prices that encourage the largest volume of production and the largest volume of sales. The best wage rates for labor are not the highest wage rates, but the wage rates that permit full production, full employment and the largest sustained payrolls. The best profits, from the standpoint not only of industry but of labor, are not the lowest profits, but the profits that encourage most people to become employers or to provide more employment than before.
> 
> If we try to run the economy for the benefit of a single group or class, we shall injure or destroy all groups, including the members of the very class for whose benefit we have been trying to run it. We must run the economy for everybody.



> One **function of profits**, in brief, is to guide and channel the factors of production so as to apportion the relative output of thousands of different commodities in accordance with demand. No bureaucrat, no matter how brilliant, can solve this problem arbitrarily. Free prices and free profits will maximize production and relieve shortages quicker than any other system. Arbitrarily-fixed prices and arbitrarily-limited profits can only prolong shortages and reduce production and employment.



> Profits, in short, resulting from the relationships of costs to prices, not only tell us which goods it is most economical to make, but which are the most economical ways to make them.



> **Real wealth, of course, consists in what is produced and consumed** [as opposed to money]: the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the houses we live in. It is railways and roads and motor cars; ships and planes and factories; schools and churches and theaters; pianos, paintings and books.



> ... any substantial increase in the quantity of money will reduce the purchasing power of each individual monetary unit — in other words, that it will lead to an increase in commodity prices.



> Just as there is no technical improvement that would not hurt someone, so there is no change in public taste or morals, even for the better, that would not hurt someone.
>
> ... But the solution is never to reduce supplies arbitrarily, to prevent further inventions or discoveries, or to support people for continuing to perform a service that has lost its value...
