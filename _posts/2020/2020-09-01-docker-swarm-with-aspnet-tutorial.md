I tried to follow the first half of ["Scale ASP.NET Core Apps with Docker Swarm Mode"](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/scale-asp-net-core-apps-with-docker-swarm-mode) tutorial but I encountered lots of errors because that tutorial was written for a preview version of .NET Core, 1.0.0-preview2-003121. To save you from the errors, here is a guide to that same tutorial but for ASP.NET Core 3.1 using Visual Studio 2019.

### Windows 10 prerequisites:

- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
- [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download#windows)

### Step 1: Create ASP.NET project

Using Visual Studio 2019, create an ASP.NET Web API project named `TokenGen`.

Be sure to **"Enable Docker Support"** by clicking on the chechbox as shown in the image below.

![Visual Studio 2019 - New ASP.NET Web API project with Docker support enbled](/images/2020/aspnet-web-api-enable-docker-support.png)

It will create a `Dockerfile` with these contents:

{: .small }
``` shell
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1-buster-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1-buster AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["TokenGen/TokenGen.csproj", "TokenGen/"]
RUN dotnet restore "TokenGen/TokenGen.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/TokenGen"
RUN dotnet build "TokenGen.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "TokenGen.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "TokenGen.dll"]
```

(For an explanation on what these `Dockerfile` contents mean, you can refer to this: ["How Visual Studio builds containerized apps (version vs-2019)"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/container-build?view=vs-2019))


After the projects is created, go to the `Controllers` folder and add a new controller named `TokenController` with the following content:


``` csharp
namespace TokenGen.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class TokenController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public dynamic Get()
        {
            return new
            {
                Guid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(1),
                Issuer = Environment.MachineName
            };
        }
    }
}
```

(You can see the resulting project in this public GitHub [repository](https://github.com/jeremiahflaga/containers-playground/tree/master/2020-08-27-docker-swarm).)


### Step 2: Create Docker image

Open a command window in **root folder** of the project created in Step 1 (the folder where the `.sln` file is located).

Execute this command to build a Docker image named `tokengen-img`:

``` shell
docker build -t tokengen-img -f ./TokenGen/Dockerfile .
```

After that, when you execute 

``` shell
docker images
```

you will see `tokengen-img` as one of the images listed.

```
REPOSITORY                             TAG                 IMAGE ID
tokengen-img                           latest              be76db52e663
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk      3.1-buster          9ab567a29502
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet   3.1-buster-slim     bdca989bc8d3
```


### Step 3: Create Docker container

Execute this command to create and run a container named `tokengen` based on the `tokengen-img` image created in Step 2

``` shell
docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name tokengen tokengen-img
```

Then execute 

``` shell
docker ps
```

in the command line.

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED
4ead1d345897        tokengen-img:latest   "dotnet TokenGen.dll"    9 seconds ago
```

Take note of the `CONTAINER ID` of the `tokengen` container.


Now, open a **PowerShell** window then run this:

``` shell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5000/api/token
```

You will get a response that looks similar to this:

```
guid                                   expires                      issuer
----                                   -------                      ------
5b8b8613-b98d-40c1-befe-1531dd6e899b   2020-08-27T08:23:18.82197Z   4ead1d345897
```


Take note of that `issuer`. You will see that the `CONTAINER ID` of the `tokengen` container is that same as that `issuer` value.


Now, before going to the Docker Swarm part, stop and delete the container by using the following commands:

``` shell
docker stop tokengen
docker rm tokengen
```


### Step 4: Use Docker Swarm

First, enable Docker Swarm mode by executing this command:

``` shell
docker swarm init
```

Then create a service. (For an explanation of the difference between a Docker container and a Docker service, go [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46646524/1451757).)

``` shell
docker service create --publish 5000:80 --name tokengen tokengen-img
```

Execute this command to check if the service is running:

``` shell
docker service ls
```

```
ID             NAME      MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE                PORTS
ciofdg2cipr3   tokengen  replicated  1/1       tokengen-img:latest  *:5000->80/tcp
```

Execute this `scale` command to run replicas of the application.

``` shell
docker service scale tokengen=3
```

Try to execute the command

``` shell
docker ps
```

again. It will show 3 `tokengen` containers:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                 CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
7d8d43844153        tokengen-img:latest   "dotnet TokenGen.dll"   34 seconds ago      Up 32 seconds       80/tcp, 443/tcp     tokengen.2.tw1shkml1y0igeqzcp7y5d56e
92ede130d311        tokengen-img:latest   "dotnet TokenGen.dll"   34 seconds ago      Up 32 seconds       80/tcp, 443/tcp     tokengen.3.vwx6vk2y5ft7mvcd84q98ywce
a544a46bf2cc        tokengen-img:latest   "dotnet TokenGen.dll"   6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        80/tcp, 443/tcp     tokengen.1.nb2ro0wg7gvaos897o8wq0mj7
```

Open 3 PowerShell windows and run `Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5000/api/token`:


![3 PowerShell windows running Invoke-RestMethod](/images/2020/docker-swarm-3-powershell-windows.png)

Note that the `issuer` in the responses have three different values, which corresponds to the IDs of the three replicas of the application.


To delete the service, execute this command:

``` shell
docker service rm tokengen
```

That's all folks.
