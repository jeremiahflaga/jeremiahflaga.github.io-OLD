> **"The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed."** - Peter Block (through Woody Zuill in the beginning of his [talk on "Mob Programming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLEsWB1wZMA))


Following what [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/books-read-2017/) had been doing, I am listing here the books I have read the past year.


**Here is my list for 2019:**

<!--more-->


<small>NOTE: Almost all, if not all, of my readings here are what [Mortimer Adler](https://www.bookdepository.com/How-Read-Book-Mortimer-J-Adler/9781476790152?a_aid=jflaga) calls _Inspectional Reading_ . You cannot expect me to have already _mastered_ all the materials presented in the books listed below. I will have to reread them to master them. :smile: </small>

## week 1 & 2 of ["IT Security: Defense against the digital dark arts - Coursera"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/it-security) by Google

<small><small>
_(Jun 20 - Jul 7, course from Coursera)_
</small></small>

I took this course because I needed to learn more about authentication and authorization and other security-related topics. And because it is offered by Google rather than by a university, I assumed that the lectures or contents of the course will be easy to understand :grin: ... They are easy to understand!

One of the greatest books ever written!

Here's a youtube video of a summary of this book: ["Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis Animated Book Review/Summary"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mA_QCRn0p0). The quote at the end of that video was the thing which made me to want to buy this book. Also, a facebook friend, who I am still to meet in person :smile:, Nick Solana, had recommended _any_ C.S. Lewis book for me to read.

**You have to read this book!**
