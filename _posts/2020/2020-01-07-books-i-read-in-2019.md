> **"The value of another's experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed."** - Peter Block (through Woody Zuill in the beginning of his [talk on "Mob Programming"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLEsWB1wZMA))


Following what [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/books-read-2017/) had been doing, I am listing here the books I have read the past year.


**Here is my list for 2019:**

<!--more-->


<small>NOTE: Almost all, if not all, of my readings here are what [Mortimer Adler](https://www.bookdepository.com/How-Read-Book-Mortimer-J-Adler/9781476790152?a_aid=jflaga) calls _Inspectional Reading_ . You cannot expect me to have already _mastered_ all the materials presented in the books listed below. I will have to reread them to master them. :smile: </small>

## week 1 & 2 of ["IT Security: Defense against the digital dark arts - Coursera"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/it-security) by Google

<small><small>
_(Jun 20 - Jul 7, course from Coursera)_
</small></small> 

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera_assets/lady_looking_at_computer.png" height="200">

I took this course because I needed to learn more about authentication and authorization and other security-related topics. And because it is offered by Google rather than by a university, I assumed that the lectures or contents of the course will be easy to understand :grin: ... They are easy to understand!

One of the greatest books ever written!

Here's a youtube video of a summary of this book: ["Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis Animated Book Review/Summary"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mA_QCRn0p0). The quote at the end of that video was the thing which made me to want to buy this book. (Also, a facebook friend, who I am still to meet in person 
<!-- :smile:, Nick Solana,  -->
had recommended _any_ C.S. Lewis book for me to read.)

**You have to read this book!**

{#the-mythical-man-month}
## chapters 1-9, 11-12, 16-17 of ["The Mythical Man-Month (Anniversary Edition)"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Frederick-P-Brooks-Jr/9780201835953?a_aid=jflaga) by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.

_(Sept 19 - Oct, physical book barrowed from the mini library of [Arcanys](https://www.arcanys.com))_

The major lesson I learned from this book is the importance of what the author calls ["Conceptual integrity" of a software system](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/0201835959/samplechapter/chap4.html):

> I will contend that conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design. **It is better to have a system omit certain anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one set of design ideas, than to have one that contains many good but independent and uncoordinated ideas.**

> Conceptual integrity in turn dictates that the design must proceed from one mind, or from a very small number of agreeing resonant minds.
>
> ... I will certainly not contend that only the architects will have good architectural ideas. Often the fresh concept does come from an implementer or from a user. However, all my own experience convinces me, and I have tried to show, that **the conceptual integrity of a system determines its ease of use. Good features and ideas that do not integrate with a system's basic concepts are best left out.** If there appear many such important but incompatible ideas, one scraps the whole system and starts again on an integrated system with different basic concepts.

Too bad I did not learn this much earlier in my career as a programmer.
