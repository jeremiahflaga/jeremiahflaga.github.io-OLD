A few days ago I found [this piano tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6S8RCKRIoY) by someone named Antoine Hervé. The video was in French, but because there were English subtitles on the screen I still got what he was trying to say. 

This tutorial is very good because the rhythm pattern for playing bossa nova is clearly explained --- step by step. (Lucky me I continued watching the video even though it was not in English.)

I practiced what he taught in the video and I greatly enjoyed it. This is my first time playing a rhythmically complex piece of music. :blush: 

I also created a transcription of what he played in the video.

Transcribing by ear is very hard for me --- I do not have perfect pitch, and I was not trained to transcribe. Thankfully today we already have videos available everywhere, so it's now possible to transcribe using both by sight and ear (mainly by 'sight', in my case). I hope that by doing this, transcribing by ear will become easier for me someday... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: _I hope..._

Here's the transcription (with some modifications of my own):

Enjoy!
