**Why doesn't God physically reveal Himself?**

William Lane Craig has an answer to that question: ["Why doesn't God physically reveal Himself?"
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBIsLTQ-GKQ)

I also have an answer to that question which focuses more on the emotional aspect of that question.

When we hear questions like that, we sometimes forget that God has emotions too. He is not a robot.

(TLDR: Why doesn't God physically reveal Himself?? Because we would reject and murder him over and over again if he does! Do we have any idea how much **that hurts**!?)

<!--more-->

We do have idea how much it hurts being rejected. It hurts more when that happens so many times.

Now, let's imagine for a while that we were able to create machines that can somewhat think like we humans think; and that these machines have a little bit of free will in them. Then someone from our world went inside their world, the "virtual" world. Let's call that someone Juan.

Juan is very happy to meet these human-like machines in the virtual world -- he wants to find out how they are doing. 

Juan teaches them how things can be done "better" than how they are currently doing them. Some are happy that Juan is there; some are not. Then Juan claimed that he came from the world outside the virtual world, and that even if he is eliminated from the virtual world he can come back anytime he wants.

Some are joyed by that. Some are skeptical.

The sceptical ones said prove it.
