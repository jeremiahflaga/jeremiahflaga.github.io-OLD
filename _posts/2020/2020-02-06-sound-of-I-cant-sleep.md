[[Midi file]](/files/music/2020-02-06-sound-of-i-cant-sleep.mid)

The sheet music does not seem to look like the sound produced by the midi file. But because I do not yet know how to edit the sheet music, and I have not yet figured out how it's supposed to look, I will just leave it like that for now.

**Update:**

That is not really the sound of "I can't sleep" :laughing". I just have been listening to [Chopin Nocturne Op. 9 No. 1 in B-flat Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myRTkyWejfo) before that sound came to my mind while trying to get to sleep when I cannot sleep.
