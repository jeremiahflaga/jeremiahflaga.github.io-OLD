Are you getting this error when you click on the Login button of the eShopOnContainers project? Or when you click on the Authorize button of a swagger page in that project?:

```
Sorry, there was an error : unauthorized_client
```

<!--more-->

Here's what solved it for me:

**Step 1:**

Open the file `src/.env`


The solution is so simple, but I'm going to put it here so that [I will know where to look when I forget this in the future](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheVBEquivalentToCTypeofKeyword.aspx):

That's it.

Enjoy!
