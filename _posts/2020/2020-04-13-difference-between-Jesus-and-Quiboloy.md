The difference is that Jesus claimed to be divine in a society who kills people who claim to be divine. Jesus endured till death without renouncing his claims.

Quiboloy, on the other hand, lives in a society who does not kill people for claiming to be divine.

Perhaps this society will kill someone who claims to be the devil and do things that the devil does(?) If he claims of being the devil and do things the devil does, and if during his trial he will not renounce his claim, people might believe him ðŸ˜›
