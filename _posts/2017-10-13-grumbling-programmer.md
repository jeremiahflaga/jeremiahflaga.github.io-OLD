I am one of those grumbling programmers sometimes. (Read this blog post of mine a few months ago [link here post on WTF)

I am one of those grumbling people sometimes. (Or many times?)

I never thought that grumbling was very bad until about two weeks ago; when my brother in law, Orland Pervandos, talked about murmuring and complaining as one of the "common temptations" that the Corinthians were experiencing; and that murmuring and complaining are the first two "ungodly deeds" listed in Jude 16.

[insert here that grumbling is like saying that God is incompetent… what you learned from the article from desiring god



What could possibly heal these grumblings?

	“… consider that the code you’re working on is your code. Even if you haven’t written it yourself, and regardless of how good or bad you think it is, this is your code, and you have responsibility over it.”
	
	From <http://127.0.0.1:4000/good-stuffs/> 
	
	
	[insert here another quote from Eric Evans on legacy code]
	
	
	
I also noticed that when someone criticizes but gives a solution to the problem, the criticism become less offensive; and it has become helpful to the one being criticized.
