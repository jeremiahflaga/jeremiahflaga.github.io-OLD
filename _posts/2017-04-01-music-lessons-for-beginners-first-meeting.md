<!-- April 1, 2017 11:50:00 PM Philippine Time -->

This afternoon, I started (again) music lessons for beginners in our small church in our small city, Kidapawan, Philippines.

I'm writing this just to document what I am doing so that if this lessons will happen again in the future, I can refer to this post again for ideas on what to teach.

I had 4 students.

Before our lesson started (after the Bible reading and prayer of course), I made them listen and watch [Greg Howlett](https://greghowlett.com/?affid=5114) play "His Eye is On The Sparrow".

<small>[In case you are interested, Here is his [blog post about his work on "His Eye is On the Sparrow"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/thoughts/010911.aspx) ]

After watching that, I asked them if they want to become as good as Greg Howlett.

They said "Yes!" of course!

Then I told them that I am not able to make them as good as Greg Howlett :smile: ... but I am able to teach them basic concepts about music and the piano.

I told them that if they want to become like Greg Howlett, they can make him their teacher someday, and learn lots of stuff from him, when they already have a job and can be able to pay for his online music school.
