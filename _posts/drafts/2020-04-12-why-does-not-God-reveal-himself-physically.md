**Why doesn't God physically reveal Himself?**

William Lane Craig has an answer to that question: ["Why doesn't God physically reveal Himself?"
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBIsLTQ-GKQ)

I also have an answer to that question which focuses more on the emotional aspect of that question.

When we hear questions like that, we sometimes forget that God has emotions too. He is not a robot.

(TLDR: Why doesn't God physically reveal Himself?? Because we would reject and murder him over and over again if he does! Do we have any idea how much **that hurts**!?)

<!--more-->

We do have idea how much it hurts being rejected. It hurts more when that happens so many times!

Now, let's imagine for a while that we were able to create programs that can somewhat think like we humans think; and that these programs have a little bit of free will in them. Then someone from our world went inside their world, the "virtual" world. Let's call that someone Juan.

Juan is very happy to meet these human-like programs in the virtual world -- he wants to find out how they are doing. 

When Juan arrives in the virtual world, he began teaching the human-like programs how things can be done "better" than how they are currently doing them. Some are happy that Juan is there; some are not. "What is this new program doing here. He thinks he is better at doing things than us?". Then Juan claimed that he came from the world outside the virtual world, and that even if he is eliminated from the virtual world he can come back anytime he wants.

"Anytime you want? At your will?"

Some are joyed by that. "Really? Wow!"

Some are skeptical. "There are lots of programs who disappeared before who came back much later with more information in them. How could you be different than them?"

The skeptical ones want Juan to prove that he came from another world.

"Remember that problem you had yesterday that I did not know how to solve? I can find someone from my world to solve that, then I will go back here with the solution."

"Okay."

Juan went out from the virtual world into the human world. He told his colleague about a problem they had in the virtual world.

(Please note that in this story, it is assumed that Juan exists from the perspective of the machines, just as the question "Why doesn't God physically reveal Himself?" assumes that God exists.)
