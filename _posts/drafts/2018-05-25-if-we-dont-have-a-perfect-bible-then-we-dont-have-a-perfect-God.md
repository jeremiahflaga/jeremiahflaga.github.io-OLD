I think that is the same as saying, "If we don't have a perfect creation, then we don't have a perfect God".

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Okay...

That statement in the title... I said that to myself when I was about 17 years old.

You see, I was raised up in an environment where people believe that the word of God is _perfect_. And by the "word of God" we mean the Bible, both the Old and New Testatments.

> "The law of the LORD is perfect..." --- from the Psalms

And if you are familiar with the Bible, you might also know that there are lots of Bibles in the world; I mean, there are lots of different versions of the Bible; lots of translations. In English for example, there are these: KJV, RSV, ESV, NASB, NIV, NLT, ERV, BBE, CEV, TLB, etc.

And there are a few passages where they say different things. Compare for instance I John 5:7-8 in KJV and ESV:

> **KJV:**
<br /><br />
1Jn 5:7  For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
<br />
1Jn 5:8  And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

> **ESV:**
<br /><br />
1Jn 5:7  For there are three that testify:
<br />
1Jn 5:8  the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.

See the difference?

Either the KJV translators _added_ something to the Bible, or the ESV translators _ommitted_ something from the Bible, right? _(Or did they?)_ And adding or ommitting something from the Bible is prohibited in the Bible itself (in Revelation 22:18-19 and Prov 30:6). Tsk tsk!

Some people regarded this as a very serious matter. And I did consider this a very serious matter.

My father had a copy of the book which relates to this matter; ["The Answer Book"](https://samgipp.com/answerbook/) by Samuel Gipp. I read it, and I was convinced --- we have a perfect Bible, and it is in the King James Version of the Bible. Yehey!

Then a few years later, I started to ask, "Why do most Christians not care whether or not we have a perfect Bible. Most Christians seems to be okay to use any Bible they want."


"What if I try to become an enemy of Christians, and use this issue of "the perfect Bible" to convince them that Christianity is not true?"

But many years later, I saw this [debate by James White and Jack Moorman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwe_nxeVwE0). In that debate Dr. James White said that the 1 John 5:7-8 in the KJV Bible, also called the ["Comma Johanneum"](https://www.gotquestions.org/Comma-Johanneum.html), is not found in any of the early Greek manuscripts of 1 John. It was only added in the third edition of what is now known as the "Textus Receptus", the Greek text compiled by Erasmus in the 16th century.

And this Textus Receptus is the text where the KJV Bible was translated from!








In a perfect world, we would have a perfect Bible, I would say.

But we are not living in a perfect world. We might not have a perfect version of the Bible, but that does not mean that we don't have God's word.

The next question would be, "How would we know whether a specific verse of the Bible has been corrupted or not?"
