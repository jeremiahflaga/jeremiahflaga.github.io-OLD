> If it causes pain, it must be bad.

That is one of the most basic assumptions of many (if not all) people, including me, of course.

> If it causes more pain, it must be badder than bad
	
… or, how do we say it? 

... worse
	
> If it causes more pain, it must be worse.
	
Maybe using the word "evil" is better…

	If it causes pain, then it must be evil.
	
	If it causes more pain, then it must be more evil.
	
Okay… enough playing around with terminology.










And because of that, many people ask the question,

	If God is good (not bad), why does he permit pain and suffering?
	





But nobody (I think) wants to believe in a cruel god (perhaps because we know in our heart of hearts that the real God must be good). So eventually, those who believe in an "eat-or-be-eaten" kind of universe will rebel against whoever god they believe in --- to the point of denying the existence of any god.




The earlier you do something about the pain, the better.




I recently watched Michael Feather's talk "The Deep Synergy Between Testability and Good Design".









Least amount of pain to least number of people

Of course this assumes that we know what causes pain to people.

I can think of three things we can know what causes pain.

	1. When we experience the pain first hand
	2. When we hear/read other's first-hand experience of it
	3. When the original designer of a system tells us if something causes pain or not.


Because our Designer did not give us a rule book on how to design computer systems (because we do not want him to… because we want to experience everything first-hand, right?), we only have two options left.
