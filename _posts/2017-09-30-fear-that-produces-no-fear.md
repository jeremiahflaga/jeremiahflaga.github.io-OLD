Maybe you are familiar with these kinds of programming jokes.

If we give time to think more on these jokes, we will start to realize that it seems like the authors of the joke are programmers themselves; and they are trying to say that coding is a dangerous thing to do --- that programmers will be in danger if they are not careful with how they write code.

It seems like they are trying to instill fear in the hearts of programmers, including themselves of course.

It seems like thay are trying to say that we, programmers, have this secret fear...

... **the fear of becoming slaves of our software creations**.

The fear that we will be controlled by our software instead of us controlling our software.
