when i first encountered recursion... What?!

Then, when I encountered it again after a few months... Ok!

Then [after a few months again... Great!!](http://jeremiahflaga.blogspot.com/2011/09/recursion-stanfords-cs106b-assignment.html)

Recursion is very hard to understand at first (except maybe when you are a genius). But after you encounter it many times, it will look familiar to you, like many other things, I believe.

**Arithmetic**, for example, was very hard when we first encountered it. But today, it's easy as 1-2-3. :smile:

## Recursion according to Prof. Eric Grimson
