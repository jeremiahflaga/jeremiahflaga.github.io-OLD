I recently read "The Tale of Three Kings: A study in brokeness" by Gene Edwards.

It is a small book of comfort for Christians who experienced pain and heartache in the hands of other Christians. A very beautifu book, I would say.

It tells the story of the young David in the hands of a mad king, King Saul, and the old David and the rebellion of his son Absalom.

What if testability is a property of any system for it to be considered good?



People who have gone through lots of tests, and survived, are considered good by our society.



What if systems which went through many tests tends to become good systems than those...

What if this is the reason why TDD works...


Or perhaps I'm just using 

What if when a system proves its testability during its early days then it will be easier when we need to test another part of the system
