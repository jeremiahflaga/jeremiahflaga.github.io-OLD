Those are the words of **J. B. Rainsberger (jbrains)** in his ["7 minutes, 26 seconds, and the Fundamental Theorem of Agile Software Development"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSes_PexXcA)

I found that two days ago through Uncle Bob Martin's [tweet](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1004708749376974849)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Classic.  Gorgeous.  Profound. <a href="https://t.co/9uhQ9Roosq">https://t.co/9uhQ9Roosq</a></p>&mdash; Uncle Bob Martin (@unclebobmartin) <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1004708749376974849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

But today, the [vimeo video](https://vimeo.com/79106557) in the original tweet is already gone. I don't know why. The good thing is that it's already in youtube.

Anyway...

[This comment](https://twitter.com/YellowBrickC/status/1004974374305267714) might make you more interested in watching the video (it's only about seven minutes long)!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ha! At the end you just say what <a href="https://twitter.com/RonJeffries?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ronjeffries</a> said in the &quot;dark agile&quot; article (and what I also sustain): &quot;agile cannot work without XP!&quot;<br>This would be a VERY good refactoring step for the fucked-up agile world, don&#39;t you think?</p>&mdash; Krisztina Hirth (@YellowBrickC) <a href="https://twitter.com/YellowBrickC/status/1004974374305267714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2018</a></blockquote>

Here's the context of that statement in the title:

> "The fundamental theorem of agile software development says this: **If you want to estimate little things, you have to refactor**, because refactoring is how you reduce accidental complication; and only by driving accidental complication down as far as you possibly can will your relative estimates have any meaning...
<br /><br />
"...Therefore if you're gonna estimate, you'd better refactor, which means Scrum cannot work without XP"
<br /><br />
