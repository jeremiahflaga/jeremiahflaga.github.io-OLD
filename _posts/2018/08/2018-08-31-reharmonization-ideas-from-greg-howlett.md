[Greg Howlett](http://www.greghowlett.com/default.aspx?affid=5114) is a Christian concert pianist and recording artist. I found him while searching for free sheet music online in 2010 or 2011 (I think).

I consider Greg's lessons and blog posts on music as gems for self-taught hymn playing pianists like me. I have always wondered how musicians create good sounding music, and here he is teaching, using simple and easy to understand words, how to make beautiful music.

I have watched many of his [free video lessons and blog posts on reharmonization](http://greghowlett.com/free-piano-lessons-and-arrangements-for-pianists?affid=5114) since the time I found his blog, and I started experimenting with the reharmonization ideas I learned, but I stopped about five years ago when I started working away from home where I do not have an access to a piano. :disappointed:

But I'm going to start again this time. I hope... :grin:


### Listed below are some of the reharmonization ideas I got from him.


**1. A ii chord substitues for a V chord (and a IV chord).**

**2. A iii chord substitutes for a I chord.**

**3. A vi chord substitues for a I chord or a IV chord.**

- <small>The first three above are from his blog post ["Minor chord substitutions"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/110209.aspx?affid=5114). He also has videos on this: ["Minor chord substitutions video demonstration (Part 1)"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/110509.aspx?affid=5114) and ["Minor chord substitutions video demonstration (Part 2)"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/111309.aspx?affid=5114)


**4. Change V-I cadences into ii-V-I cadences.**

- <small>From ["Reharmonization video: I Surrender All"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/072510.aspx?affid=5114); also in ["Video Lesson: What a Friend We Have In Jesus (Part 2)"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/110110a.aspx?affid=5114)</small>


**5. Insert a minor 5 (v) and dominant 1 (I7) in front of a 4 (IV) chord**

- <small>From ["Video Lesson: What a Friend We Have In Jesus (Part 1)"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/102510.aspx?affid=5114)</small>


**6. A dominant chord (V7) usually resolves down a fifth (to a I chord) or sometimes a half step.**

**7. Very often, if a progression is moving with the circle of fifths, you can change one of the normal minor chords to major (making it a secondary dominant).**

**8. Add a flat 9th to secondary dominants if resolving to a minor chord.**

- <small>Ideas 6 to 7 are from ["Secondary dominants"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/061111024.aspx?affid=5114)</small>

-  <small>Also in ["When to use secondary dominants"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/062913.aspx?affid=5114)</small>

-  <small>Another video on secondary dominants: ["Demonstration video on secondary dominants"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/demonstration-video-on-secondary-dominants.aspx?affid=5114)</small>

- <small>In a recent post, ["Choosing Between the 9th and b9th"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/choosing-between-the-9th-and-b9th.aspx?affid=5114), he also said that it is also sometimes okay to use the flat 9th to secandary dominants even when _not_ resolving to a minor chord.</small>



**9. minor 7 chords likes to resolve down a fifth or in diatonic steps.**

- <small>From ["Reharmonization of My Jesus I Love Thee"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/072010.aspx?affid=5114)</small>


**10. You can insert a diminished chord betweet 4 and 5 chords.**

- <small>From ["Video Lesson: What a Friend We Have In Jesus (Part 1)"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/102510.aspx?affid=5114)</small>


**11. You can substitue a #4 dim - minor4 6th - minor 3 - flat3 dim - ii7 - V7 -I for a V-I cadence.**

- <small>From ["Video Lesson: What a Friend We Have In Jesus (Part 4)"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/111610.aspx?affid=5114)</small>


**12. Which color note belong to each chord?**
<br /><br />
Major/Major 7th
9, #11, 13 (9 is the most common)
<br /><br />
Minor 7th
9, 11, 13 (9 is the most common)
<br /><br />
Dominant
b9, 9, #9, #11, b13, 13 (All are widely used. However, you are most likely to use b9, 9, b13, and 13.)

- <small>From ["Which color notes belong to each chord"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/color-notes.aspx?affid=5114)</small>


**13. Tritone substitution - ex. substitute a F#7 for a C7**

- <small>Learn about that [here](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/tritone1.aspx?affid=5114)


**14. Substitute I - IVm6 - iii for I - IV - I**

- <small>I cannot remember anymore where I got this but here is an article that gives an explanation about [substituting a a minor IV for a IV](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/substituting-ivm-for-iv.aspx?affid=5114)</small>

> <small>"Any time you see a IV chord, a minor IV will likely sound great. The big exception? If the melody note is the third of the IV, it will sound horrible."</small>

- <small>And here's another one: ["Piano tip – Using the minor iv chord"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/100109.aspx?affid=5114)</small>





Here is a sample of his free video lessons: ["Relating harmony to melody"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Pe84XfaNQ)
