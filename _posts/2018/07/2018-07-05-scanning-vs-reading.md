Last January, Uncle Bob wrote a blog post where points out some inconsistencies in a blog post by GeePaw Hill (who, I later learned, is a friend of his and a former employee).


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Blog: &quot;The Citizenship Argument&quot;, in answer to <a href="https://twitter.com/GeePawHill?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GeePawHill</a>&#39;s brilliant post about TDD.  <a href="https://t.co/GViS3p5LUx">https://t.co/GViS3p5LUx</a></p>&mdash; Uncle Bob Martin (@unclebobmartin) <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/954029987727925248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2018</a></blockquote>

But a few days later, Uncle Bob twitted about another blog post (with video) of GeePaw Hill. In that post, GeePaw Hill differentiates _"scanning"_ code from _"reading"_ code.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great new <a href="https://twitter.com/GeePawHill?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GeePawHill</a> video. Donâ€™t be fooled by the simple start. Much meat soon follows. <a href="https://t.co/iq2CFlCNRT">https://t.co/iq2CFlCNRT</a></p>&mdash; Uncle Bob Martin (@unclebobmartin) <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/960421063833333771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2018</a></blockquote>

And Uncle Bob commended him for it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nicely done!  Great message. The motivation for refactoring is to optimize scanning. Priceless.</p>&mdash; Uncle Bob Martin (@unclebobmartin) <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/960420626744971264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2018</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The insight that reading and scanning are different; and that scanning is the focus of refactoring, is really valuable.  I hadn&#39;t thought of that before.  So thank YOU.</p>&mdash; Uncle Bob Martin (@unclebobmartin) <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/960493764480524289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2018</a></blockquote>

A conversation by the greats!... Priceless!!!

And new lessons to remember: **"reading and scanning are different"** and **"scanning is the focus of refactoring"**.
