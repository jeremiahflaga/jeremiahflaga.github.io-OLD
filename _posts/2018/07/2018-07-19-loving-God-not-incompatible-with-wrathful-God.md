But any loving person is often filled with wrath.

 --- Timothy Keller


As you might have already guessed, this is about the recent ruckus about President Rodrigo R. Duterte's comments on "a loving God" and "hell".

<!--more-->

Now, first of all, I'm a supporter of President Duterte :smile:. I voted for him in the last presidential elections. 

That does not mean, of course, that I agree with every decision that he has made or will ever make. (I don't actually have enough knowledge to evaluate decisions of a president, but I think _no one_ agrees with _anyone_ on _everything_... that's the reason why I say those words: I think I don't agree with anyone on everything, even though I believe that we all must _eventually_ agree with God.) 

_"I'm a supporter"_ only means that I believe that he is truthful and sincere with his motives towards serving the Filipino people; not like _some_ of the other politicians out there whose goal is just to make money or to make themselves famous out of politics. Being famous is not necessarily wrong, of course. A politician will become famous whether he likes it or not. But if becoming famous is the primary reason why one wants to run for office in the government... there are other ways to become famous... we should give government offices to those who really want to serve the people.

<small>(Also, please note that I said _some_. If you were not able to see the _some_ word in there, perhaps you are or will be one of those _some_. Tread carefully, because all of us are succeptible into doing these things we thought we don't like; things we thought we hate.)</small>

Okay back to President Duterte... _(I always do that... I always stray from my main topic...)_

Did the President really said these things about God and hell?

Good thing that we already have google and youtube today... so even when we are very late with the news, we can still _easily_ verify things...

... So those things I heard are true.

He is questioning what the God of Christianity did in the garden of Eden (or, as others put it, he is questioning the account of the writers of the Bible of what the Creator did).

Well, if the Creator is all-knowing and all-loving, as what the Bible depicts him to be, we can [question all we want](https://www.gotquestions.org/question-God.html), but will we able to fully grasp the answer?

We will only become like Job who in the end just said, "I have spoken too soon..."

Of course the President is free to believe in whatever god he wants to believe in. But I have to disagree with him on his comments that a loving God _should_ not send people to hell.

A loving and good God must hate evil, just like a loving president would hate evil. The President himself says that he hates drugs (by that he means those drugs which destroys the mind), because these things destroy his people... and he is doing something to stop those who perpetuate these evil deeds. The same is true with a loving God, I believe.

I do not know why God does not bring justice to all people in this life, but I believe, through the [testimony of Scriptures](https://www.gotquestions.org/trust-the-Bible.html), that he will bring justice in the life to come.

Now, the President also said that he does not believe in heaven, so we cannot accuse him by saying, "Does he want Hitler to go to heaven also?". We cannot say that.

Now, one is free to believe or not to believe in heaven or in hell. But to say that a loving God is incompatible with a God full of wrath... that is incorrect already, and we have to correct it.

And if a loving God can also be a God full of wrath, then those unrepentant people, [even unrepentant priests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQlDs6-woVM), even unrepentant church leaders, God will send them to hell. A God who loves his people will send those who want to destroy his people to hell.

Okay case closed...

And what about President Duterte?...

... Of course that does not mean that we cannot point out mistakes of people in this life... we should.. or else we will all be doomed...


I hope that President Duterte will [someday change his mind](
