I heard that term used by Martin Fowler in the "Is TDD dead [Part V & VI]" hangout.

They were talking about Agile and the lost of the meaning of Agile over time.

Martin Fowler calles the phenomenon "Semantic Difussion" --- the loss of the meaning of something over time.

[add here Uncle Bob's statement of something "good" becomes popular...]

[add here Dr. Kamibayashiyama statement regarding this... When Constantine converted to Christianity the other officials also converted to christianity. They called themselves Christians but inwardly they were not.]

[add here Albert Mohler's interview on The Benedict Option... how the Benedictine order became corrupted (as I remember him saying, I'm not sure... need to verify)]


[finally, add here things about the essence of Christianity and how things have moved towards legalism]

I think the essence of Christianity is telling the world about the only way of salvation which is through Christ Jesus.
