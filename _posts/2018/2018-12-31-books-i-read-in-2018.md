Following what [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/) is doing, [I started listing the books I read the entire year.](/2018/01/31/books-i-read-in-2017)

Here is my list in 2018:


### ["How to Win Friends and Influence People"](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780091906818?a_aid=jflaga) by Dale Carnegie

This is the third time, I think, I read this book.

The first and second time is through an old pocket book (printed in January 1948!), which my father bought from a book sale. He gave it to me last 2006 I think. The first few pages hooked me. I must have thought, _"This will be one of those great guides in life!_"

Then, during the first missions conference at BFBS last 2007, I heard one of the preachers recommending it for Christians to read!

This is one of those books that are called "Self-Help" books. And I understand that these kinds of books are being criticised by some (link here to Albert Mohler's article on self-help books). There might be some negative effects through books like these... but just try to get those good parts and apply it in your life. The bad parts... just ignore them. :smile: (By _good_ I mean those things which our creator taught us.)


### ["The ManCode"](/memorabilia/books/the-mancode-quotes/) by Dr. Dennis Swanberg and Ron Smith

This is one of the first books I bought at BookSale in SM City Davao in late 2017. The title is very interesting... I was thinking that it might help me become a man.


> **You can't stand to be alone with yourself because you weren't created to be alone.** 
<br /><br />
> ... [But] you're not only wired to need a relationship with God, **you're also hardwired to want things your own way**.
<br /><br />
> ... To crack the ManCode, **you've got to decide who's in charge: you or God**.


### "True Riches" by Todd A. Sinelli

This is a short book --- about 70 pages --- but it contains timeless treasures.

This is one of those treasures:

> Whatever you apply money to can grow and flourish.
<br /><br />
> Sherman Smith, a pastor and business scholar, writes, "From my experiences in dealing with people and their finances, I have learned one important lesson: The way money is used determines whether it becomes a curse of a blessing."
<br /><br />
> When we take our money, **time**, talent, or treasures and share them with a person in need, with the church, or when we perform any act of selfless giving, we are **pouring energy** into these things and saying **"grow and flourish"**.
<br /><br />
> The opposite holds true. If we take our money and use it to buy drugs, filth, or unholy things, we are in essence giving energy to these items and saying "grow and flourish".

### "Doing the Impossible" by Neil E. Jackson, Jr.


### [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.bookdepository.com/Working-Effectively-with-Legacy-Code-Michael-Feathers/9780131177055?a_aid=jflaga) by Michael Feathers


I already read the first eight chapters last 2017, but I decided to start reading this book from the beginning this 2018, because I wanted to better understand the idea of "seams" which is foundational in understanding the remaining part of the book.
