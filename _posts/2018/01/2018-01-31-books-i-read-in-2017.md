Following what [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/books-read-2017/) had been doing, I will start listing the books that I have read at the end of each year...


### ["Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided By Tests" (GOOS)](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga) by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce

<img src="/images/2017/growing-oo-software-guided-by-tests-book.jpg" height="250" title="GOOS image" alt="GOOS image">

Learned about what they call Outside-In TDD (Or [London School of TDD](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/the-london-school-of-test-driven-development/) as what Emily Bache calls it) --- writing both End-to-End tests (also called functional tests or acceptance tests by others) and writing unit tests at the same time.

(Secret: I skipped some chapters in Part III because there are lots of code already and I find it hard to follow. I only wanted to glean general ideas during the time that I read this. But this book is a classic, so I'm going to read this again... later...)

### [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/praise.harry.html) (first seven chapters only)

<img src="https://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920029533/cat.gif" height="250">

Same idea presented in [GOOS](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga) --- Outside-In TDD. But this is more of a tutorial-for-beginners kind of book, so it is easier to follow than [GOOS](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga).


<!-- 
Some chapters of [24 Deadly Sins of Software Security](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780071626750?a_aid=jflaga)
 -->


### ["Computer Science Distilled"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Computer-Science-Distilled-Wladston-Ferreir-Filho-Raimondo-Pictet/9780997316025?a_aid=jflaga) by Wladston Filho

<img src="/images/2017/computer-science-distilled.png" height="250">

I had written a blog post about this book [here](/2017/07/02/computer-science-distilled-feedback).


### [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.bookdepository.com/Working-Effectively-with-Legacy-Code-Michael-Feathers/9780131177055?a_aid=jflaga) by Michael Feathers (only the first eight chapters for now, and chapter 16)

<img src="https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/1311/9780131177055.jpg" height="250">

The authors of GOOS recommended this book.

Also, I heard/read Martin Fowler said that books like this one is very important because most programmers do not go to software development jobs and be involved in starting new projects. Most software projects out there are in the maintenance phase. Books like this is very valuable to programmers involved in these kinds of projects.



### [Clean Architecture](https://www.bookdepository.com/Clean-Architecture-Robert-C-Martin/9780134494166?a_aid=jflaga) (Rough Cuts - September 2016) by Robert C. Martin (using Safari Books Online)

<img src="https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/1344/9780134494166.jpg" height="250">

You can also learn the things presented here in Uncle Bob's blog posts and talks on Clean Architecture. But a book is more structured and complete, of course.



### [The Clean Coder](https://www.bookdepository.com/Clean-Coder-Robert-C-Martin/9780137081073?a_aid=jflaga) by Robert C. Martin (using Safari Books Online)

<img src="https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/1370/9780137081073.jpg" height="250">

Uncle Bob Martin experienced being fired from work when he was still young!



### Free version of [Square One: The Foundations of Knowledge](http://steve-patterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SquareOne_PDF.pdf) by Steve Patterson

<img src="http://steve-patterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SquareOneSmall.jpg" height="250">

Philosophy...



### Free version of [What's the Big Deal About Bitcoin?](http://steve-patterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WhatsTheBigDealAboutBitcoin.pdf) by Steve Patterson

<img src="http://steve-patterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BitcoinBookCover_V2Small.jpg" height="250">

The technology behind Bitcoin can someday help farmers sell their products directly to their customers!


### Lampara Books Illustrated Classics Collection's "A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens, condensed by [Ma. Renita Diano Ramos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marenitadianoramos/)

This is actually a book for children (which I found in National Bookstore of SM Ecoland Davao). I just became interested with this because of the "A Tale of Two" phrase in the title. I saw this "A Tale of Two" phrase from [one of Eddie Bush's articles](http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/clean-architecture-a-tale-of-two-stories/) on Clean Architecture and from chapter two of Uncle Bob Martin's book "Clean Architecture" --- The title of chapter two was "A Tale of Two Values". I was curious about the the origin of this "Tale of Two" phrase.

A very good story. It is about sacrifice... for someone you love, perhaps... for freedom... for a better future... for the next generation... Yes! The reason why this story is a classic.


### first 7 chapters of ["Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET"](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/designing-evolvable-web/9781449337919/)



### etc.

----------

Only a few books huh!?

And I did not finish some of the books (at least not yet)... Well, I have not yet formed the habit of goal-setting and sticking to that goal until it is finished. I'm still at the phase where my mind is still wandering from one thing to another without finishing the former first. The first week, _"I have to do SICP"_... The second week, _"I need to concentrate on studying Android development because that is the platform I currently use at work"_... The third week, _"I need to finish Nand2Tetris... because it is foundational"_... The next week, _"No... the talks of Uncle Bob Martin and Mark Seeman are also foundational"_... Another week, "I have to review ASP.NET because I need to find a job using my knowledge on that"... "You have to learn network programming"... "You have to do The Craftsman Series first!"... "You need to learn F#"... "You need to read How to Win Friends and Influence People again"...

Tsk! tsk!

<br />

Well, to fool myself into thinking that I already accomplished a significant amount of work on _reading books_ (it is still work, right?), I will  also list here some of the other books I read in the past... just to give myself hope, a tap in the back(?), encouragement to continue, ... :smile:


## Books I read in 2016



### The Rosie Project

- A book recommended to read by Bill Gates. Bad for young Christians to read, I think... but lots of funny moments... supposed to be a gift for someone :(


### The Ultimate Proof of Creation by Jason Lisle

 - Great book. I learned that people who throw questions regarding your worldview might not have an answer to those questions themselves.

###  etc.(?) - not sure if I read other books during this time because this was during the very depressing times of my life  :smile:


<!-- 
which started in May 2014

## Books I read in 2015


### Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther (first half only, will finish this later)

- I learned that Luther was just an ordinary monk who wanted to stand for the truth. But he became one of the very important figures in the Reformation.

### "Overcoming the Dark Side of Leadership: How to Become an Effective Leader by Confronting Potential Failures" (a book I borrowed from my brother-in-law)

### The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho

###  etc.(?) - not sure if I read other books during this time because this was during the very depressing times of my life :smile:
