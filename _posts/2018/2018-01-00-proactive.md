The last time I remember hearing that word is when it was used by our most senior software developer in my first job.

He said that he wants us to be proactive, and not just reactive.

What does that mean?

_[google...]_

I googled for it, of course...

Perhaps you already heared someone say something like "a rich vocabulary mean that one has understood lots of ideas" or "a rich vocabulary helps someone communicate much easily".

A corollary, I think, to that kind of statement is that someone who does not know the meaning of a specific word perhaps does not yet know about the idea that that specific word represents. Or perhaps he has not yet given that much attention to the idea being represented by that word. But that is just a "perhaps", because it's also possible for someone to understand something (perhaps not deeply) even when he is not able to put it in word(s).

... someone who does not know the meaning of a word that describes a behavior has perhaps not yet realized that that kind of behavior exists... Or perhaps he knows that it exists but he does not know that it is good... or that it is bad... or something like that.

And When the time comes where he encounter that word and understand it's meaning, that will just be the time where he realizes that he has that kind of behavior, and that he has to continue with it or change it.

I remember encountering the word "cynical" for the first time. I did not understand it. But when I looked in the dictionary for its meaning, I realized that I was that kind of person. I did not know that there is a single word to describe that kind of behavior! And I did not know that it was wrong.


The same is true when I encountered the word "proactive". I did not know that there is a word to describe that kind of behavior. But when I learned about it, I knew that I am not that kind of person. I am the negation of being a "proactive" person.

I wanted to change that during that time. But how?

I thought I was a fast learner... but today, I think I already realized that I am not. I'm just a normal learner. It gets so much time for me to understand something and to find for ways on how to do it.

And if one is not a fast learner, it takes a while before he grasps the essence of someting...




I don't want to be passive anymore. I want to be proactive already.

But like I said above, I'm not a fast learner. It might again take a while for this to sink in.

Lots of reading to do...
