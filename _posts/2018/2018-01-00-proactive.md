The last time I remember hearing that word is when it was used by our most senior software developer in my first job.

He said that he wants us to be proactive, and not just reactive.

What does that mean?

google...

I googled for it, of course.

But... perhaps you already heared someone say something like a rich vocabulary makes someone open to lots of ideas, or a rich vocabulary helps someone communicate much easily.

A corollary to that kind of statement is that someone who does not know the meaning of the word perhaps has not yet realized that a behavior of that kind exists... or that kind of behavior is good... or that kind of behavior is bad... or something like that. When the time comes where he encounter that word and understand it's meaning, that will just be the time where he realizes that he has that kind of behavior, and that he has to continue with it or change it.

I remember encountering the word cynical for the first time. I did not understand it. But when I looked in the dictionary for its meaning, I realized that I was that kind of person. I did not know that there is a single word to describe that kind of behavior


I thought I was a fast learner... but today, I think I already realized that I am not. I'm just a normal learner.

And if one is not a fast learner, it takes a while before he grasps the essence of someting...




I don't want to be passive anymore. I want to be proactive already.

But like I said above, I'm not a fast learner. It might again take a while for this to sink in.

Lots of reading to do...
