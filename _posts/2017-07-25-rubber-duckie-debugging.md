I just learned<sup id="footnote-indicator-1">[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup> that there is an actual term for the technique of _figuring out the solution of a programming problem by trying to explain it to a rubber duckie._

It's called **_"rubber duckie debugging"!_**

<!--more-->

I first heard about that technique in an article from [simpleprogrammer.com.](https://simpleprogrammer.com/)

If I remember it correctly, the writer said that if we have a problem or a bug in our code, and we find it hard to figure out the cause of the problem, we should try to explain it to a co-worker. 

But our co-workers are busy of course! We can, instead, provide for ourselves a rubber duckie and then try to explain to the rubber duckie our problem.

If I remember it correctly, the writer said that the process of explaining our problem helps us organize the problem in our brain and helps us in figuring out the solution to that problem.

Good that this is included in the lectures because it seems like I will be needing this technique in the next few weeks of my life!

Happy _rubber duckie debugging!_ :+1:
