My statement: I am a Mere Christianity kind of man because I have not studied rigorously the arguments for and againts many of the deeper doctrines of the Christian faith

If you accuse me of being a coward or being indifferent because I think like this, then I will ask you to enlighten me about the doctrine you want me to have a side on to defend. Explain to me your position on this, and the give an explanation of the other viewpoints. If you do that, it might encourage me to study more on the topic and have a strongly held position on it later on...
