<!-- started transcribing April 22, 2020 11:30:00 PM Philippine Time -->

They say that one of the ways to practice being a good musician is to transcribe songs. In the past years, transcribing can only be done by ear. These days, because we have videos available everywhere already, transcribing can be done both by sight and ear.

Transcribing by ear is very hard for me. Thankfully today we have videos so we can not transcribe both by sight and ear (mainly by sight). I hope that by doing this, transcribing by ear will be easier someday.

We had a churchmate who did not know how to sing. Then he learned to play the piano and read sheet-music and then perhaps he developed this idea on how people who sing sing.

When transcribing, you will be force to kind of analyze why the author has chosen to play it that way. And if the music you transcribed sounds very good, those decisions will add to your ideas on how to play good sounding music.
