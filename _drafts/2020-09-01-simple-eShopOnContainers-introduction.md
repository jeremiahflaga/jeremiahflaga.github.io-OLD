Please look at the overall structure of the completed project first before starting following this tutorial. Look at the folder structure: the source code are all inside the `src` folder, the catalog microservice is inside the `Catalog` folder

Please note that the Catalog and Basket microservices in here are only using this what they call CRUD-based architecture

> I'm not sure if I will recommend for you to buy this course. As for me, I am not used to the accent of the author, so there are some words in the tutorial that I cannot understand. Also some sections in the tutorial have bad audio. If you have lots of money then buy it. But if you don't have lots of money, try to listen first to the free sections of this course before deciding to buy it. Also try to ponder on [this statement by someone named `neoAnkit` in an issue page of the eShopOnContainers GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/issues/1275):
