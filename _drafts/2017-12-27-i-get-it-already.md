Each software development team is different from the other. What works in one team might not work in another.

Each team must [agree to some set of values](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/06/17/IsTddDeadFinalThoughts.html) before the start of a project.

A team must make a new participant agree to some [set of values](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2016/10/15/551B3828CD47198C7C5A58903228DA71.html).

A new member of a team must agree with the team's existing [set of values](/memorabilia/books/the-craftsman-series/#4).

I'm a [TDD fan](/quotes/tdd). But [many others are not](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/02/ProfessionalismAndTDD.html).

I have never been in a team which practices TDD, but the apps I was and am involved in are working just fine... I hope :smile:! (Actually they were not very fine if we use [Uncle Bob Martin's standards](/memorabilia/videos/expecting-professionalism-by-uncle-bob-martin/#expectations) as our measure, but I'm not going to incriminate myself or my teammates here :grin:)

So when it comes to TDD, [I'm negotiable](/2017/12/27/i-get-it-already). I'm not a TDD fanatic --- at least not yet :laughing:. But let me experience TDD... I believe I'm never going back... [I hope...](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/04/30/When-tdd-does-not-work.html) :smile:

But there's one thing I don't want to be negotiable on anymore. And that is the [proper separation of the business rules from](http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/policy-mechanism-preservation-business-value/) the other parts of the software system.

The business rules are the most important part of a software system. They are very important to the business people we work for; they must also be very important to us --- even [more important than the frameworks and databases that we love](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html). Uncle Bob Martin said that we must treat them as, what he calls, _"family jewels"_.



Still, I long for the day when all software systems will look the same --- they will all look **_"testable"_.** :smile: That means that the software systems will be easy to work with! 


_(I actually have a secret agenda for helping promote the separation of the business rules from the other parts of a software system --- when I will become a part of a team that do not practice TDD I will still do TDD with the business rules :smiling_imp:)_
