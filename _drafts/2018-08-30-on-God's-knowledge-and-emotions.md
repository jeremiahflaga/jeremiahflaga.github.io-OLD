What if the reason why many people are alarmed about machines that that can think for themselves is because we _know_ that evil can come out from that machine.
(NOTE: I just learned from Greg Bahnsen in "The Myth of Neutrality" lecture that being created in the image of God is being able to think like God thinks. ---- If that is the case then, yes, maybe we _know_ that something that has free-will, or maybe self-consciousness, or self-awareness, have the tendency of choosing evil rather than good)


All I believe today is that we are limited to only create a half-human-half-machine self-aware machines.

About 10:30 pm 
John 2:13-25 (I read the first part this morning)
verse 19 destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up... he spake of the temple of his body
	- Jesus used "this". He also used it when he said "upon this rock I will build my church"
	- He also said "I will raise it up". It implies that he will raise himself from the dead.

Verses 23-25 - Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
	- What is in man? I tried to look at the cross-reference in NIV in my phone.
	- Deut 31:21 ESV - And when many evils and troubles have come upon them, this song shall confront them as a witness (for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring). For I know what they are inclined to do even today, before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give.”
	• After reading this, I remember that an example similar to this one was given in an article I read before explaining God's omniscience in relation to man's free will -- a father knows that his child will grab a cookie if he put a plate full of them on the table, but that does not mean that the child did not have the choice NOT to grab one.
	• We have a free will but we are more inclined to do the evil than the good

Deut 31:21 - ...And when many evils and troubles have come upon them, this song shall confront them as a witness (for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring). For I know what they are inclined to do even today, before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give.”

I remember that an example similar to this one was given in an article I read a few months ago explaining God's omniscience in relation to man's free will -- a father who knows the character of his child knows that his child will grab a cookie if he put a plate full of them on the table, but that does not mean that the child did not have the choice NOT to grab one.

We have free will but we are more inclined to do the evil than the good. And our creator knows that.

What do you think?

This, I think:

"our definition of free will" might not match "our definition of omniscience"

But that does not mean that "God's definition of free will" does not match "God's definition of omniscience"

Our task then is to find out God's definition of omniscience and free will and see if they do/don't match.

Who is the God I am referring to? The God whose non-existence makes knowledge impossible.

While writing on my physical journal notebook my journal for this date, I thought that what I'm going to say during the YP fellowship id this very thing I learned from my devotions.
So I looked for cross references for verses 24-25.

Another cross reference (from ESV of my phone) is ch 6:14-15

	- 14When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, “This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!” 
	
15Perceiving then that

Listened (again), while reading the transcript, to Bahnsen-Stein debate "Does God Exists?"





While listening to "The Myth of Neutrality", I remember that I have written a note (in the Google Keep app) about "free will" last year.

I tried to search for free will….
….
…
Maybe consciousness == self-awareness




I have read some news about some people trying to convince people to think about the possible evil things that might happen if we will be able to create a machine that can think for itself.

I'm not sure if that is possible. Only time will tell.

For now, I believe that it is impossible for us humans to create something like that. I appeal to Dr. Werner Gitt for that belief. He said that "a machine will always be a machine


What if we know deep down inside that if someone or something has free will then there is the possibility of him choosing evil rather than the good.
