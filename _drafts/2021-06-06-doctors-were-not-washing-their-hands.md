Did you know that doctors were not washing their hands until ...

Well, of course, because the WHO was not there to command them on what to do

<!-- insert here quotes from Better by Atul Gawande -->

Doctors were not washing their hands before doing their thing with patients before the year... which is good because the WHO did not yet exist during that time; and the WHO is the only one who can command doctors on what to do

Did you know that doctors started washing hands in the year...

They were not supposed to be washing their hands because the WHO did not exist yet, and the WHO is the only one who can tell doctors what to do.
