Our media people, government officials, and their bureaucrats assume too much.

They assume that the people in the Philippines, citizens or not, all have the same kinds of problems. They even sometimes assume that we, ordinary citizens, have the same problems as they have. And so they provide the same solution for everyone: a solution to a problem which might be non-existing, or a solution to a problem which they created in the first place, most of the time unintentionally of course, I hope.

<!-- Sometimes they even assume that we have the same problems as they have! -->

They also assume that we know what they know. They assume that what infomation they have, we must have known them already a few moments after that information entered their minds. Maybe these government officials and bureaucrats have telepathic minds, and they assume that we also have telepathic minds like them. 

Or maybe they know that we, ordinary citizens, do not have telepathic minds, and that they are the only ones with telepathic minds. And so they are thinking that they are more humans than we are. And because of this super-human capability of telepathy, they might be thinking that they have the right to control the lives of those who do not have telepathic minds.

Or maybe they don't have telepathic minds, and they are afraid that we, ordinary citizens, will find out that they don't have the super-human capabilities they are claiming to have. And so they try to control everything to keep that truth from us.

They even assume that everyone is only thinking about how to live, instead of how to not-live, every millisecond of their lives. haha




<!-- Perhaps they just enjoy seeing other people following their orders. -->

Ahhhhh!!! I think I already know what that is the case.

They do not seem to have this **inside information** that C.S. Lewis talked about.


> There is one thing, and only one, in the whole universe which we know more about than we could learn from external observation. That one thing is Man. We do not merely observe men, we are men. In this case we have, so to speak, inside information; we are in the know. And because of that, we know that...

How is it like being human?

**Some** of our media people, government officials, and health bureaucrats do not seem to know how to be human.

They are thinking that being human means being 100% healthy; with no sickness or virus in our body whatsoever. They might even be thinking that being human means living in this material universe forever.

The truth is that their definition for human is much much worse than that: you need to have a negative result for a particular kind of test to be considered human. 

If you have a positive result for that particular test, that means that you are going to die, and so are not human, because humans live forever. So they will put you in isolation, until they can be sure that you really are a human being. If you do not die in isolation then they can be sure that you are a human being.

Maybe they have never experienced being isolated and so they do not know what being isolated feels like.

Or maybe they have experienced being isolated, but becuase they are aliens from outer space they have a different kind of isolation experience than we, mere human beings, do experience.

Or maybe they were isolated like that before by other aliens from other places in the outer space, and so they want revenge. They can't make their revenge with those aliens becuse they are more powerful than them, so they are making their revenge on us, mere human beings, because we are less powerful than those aliens who isolated them before.
