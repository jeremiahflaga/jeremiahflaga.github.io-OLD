Our government officials and their bureaucrats assume too much.

They assume that the people in the Philippines, citizens or not, all have the same kinds of problems. They even sometimes assume that we, ordinary citizens, have the same problems as they have. And so they provide the same solution for everyone: a solution to a problem which might not be existing, or a solution to a problem which they created in the first place.

<!-- Sometimes they even assume that we have the same problems as they have! -->

They also assume that we know what they know. They assume that what infomation they have, we must have known them already a few moments after that information entered their minds. Maybe these government officials and bureaucrats have telepathic minds, and they assume that we also have telepathic minds like them. 

Or maybe they know that we, ordinary citizens, do not have telepathic minds, and that they are the only ones with telepathic minds. And so they are thinking that they are more humans than we are. And because of this super-human capability of telepathy, they might be thinking that they have the right to control the lives of those who do not have telepathic minds.

Or maybe they don't have telepathic minds, and they are afraid that we, ordinary citizens, will find out that they don't have the super-human capabilities they are claiming to have. And so they try to control everything to keep that truth from us.

They even assume that everyone is only thinking about how to live, instead of how to not-live, every millisecond of their lives. haha joke lang

Which means that they are not being serious

What do our government officials do during times of crisis?

It seems like they do things with the assumption that all the people of the country they are governing have the same set of problems as they do!

For example: during this pandemic, they are assuming that all the people have seen the same news they have seen or read; nothing more, nothing less. And they are assuming that what we hear in the news 


Trying to solve a inefficiently and ineffectively solve a problem which they created in the first place.
