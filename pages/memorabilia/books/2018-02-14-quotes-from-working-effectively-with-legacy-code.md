### Preface

> "**Code without tests is bad code.**
<br />
> It doesn't matter how well written it is; it doesn't matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. 
<br />
> **With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably.**
<br />
> Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse."
<br /><br />
> --- Michael Feathers

### Chapter 8

> ... if we have tests in place, we are able to remove duplication easily.
