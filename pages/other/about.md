I'm Jeremiah Flaga, also known as Jboy.

I am software developer and loves programming!

I would also like to love mathematics, computer science, music, philosophy, and theology, but it seems like they don't have time for me today. Maybe someday they will!! --- a hundred years from now?? :grin:

I have created an online [resum&eacute;](/resume/), in case you are interested in hiring me. :smile:
