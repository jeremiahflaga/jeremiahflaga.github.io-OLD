## I never experienced being an Algorithmer

In my [résumé](/resume/#software-ninja-class), I considered myself as an [**Initiate**](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#initiate), based on Terence McGhee's "Software Ninja Class Hierarchy". But I never experienced being an [**Algorithmer**](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#algorithmer), even though it is much lower than the Initiate in that hierarchy --- _I do not have special knowledge in higher mathematics_. My weak mathematics background is the reason why I concentrated on learning how to build what they call [line-of-business (LOB) applications](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dragoman/2007/07/19/what-is-a-lob-application/) (or what is called _"representational-transactional systems"_ [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190109022046/https://aryehoffman.com/entry/classifying-software/)), because these things do not need lots of knowledge in mathematics.

But I can work with an Algorithmer, and I have high respect for an Algorithmer, because I would have liked to experience being an Algorithmer if I had the chance or education to become one when I was younger...

And I believe that working with an Algorithmer will benefit me --- I believe that I will learn a lot from an Algorithmer. I'm hoping also that an Algorithmer will learn a lot from me too, if I will be working with one.
