<!-- 
You think having an anti-résumé will put me at a disadvantage? ...

This anti-résumé (together with my [résumé](/resume)) will help me find the best job that fits my current skillset, and it will help you in determining if I am fit for your team or not. That would be _win-win_ for me and you! :blush:
