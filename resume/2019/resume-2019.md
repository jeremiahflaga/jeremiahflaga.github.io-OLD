        <p class="indented">
          This is where I was first exposed to this idea of DDD. Our employer made us read some articles about DDD because we will be using it in an in-house project. But I was not lucky to be involved in the in-house project because the employment of three junior developers, which inlcuded me, ended after six months due to a problem unbeknownst to me.
          <br /><br />
          I just saw the initial structure of the project. I saw that there was a <code>Core</code> module, which I now understand to be the module which holds the business rules. There was also an <code>Infrastructure</code> module(s), which holds the data layer, the email service, and some other parts of the system. There was no presentation layer yet during the time that I saw the project. But it has unit tests.

          I was part of a team that works for a client who develops apps for insurance companies. We were maintaining a web application that is used in enrollment for insurance and management of insurance records.
          We were using ASP.NET WebForms and the MVP design pattern to build the software. We used MS Test and Moq in writing Unit Tests. 
          We also used KnockoutJS on some pages on the web frontend.
          <br /><br />
          There was also a legacy desktop version of the application we were involved in maintaining.
          <br /><br />
          There were also a few parts of the web app that were being converted to ASP.NET MVC. But I was involved in that project for about a week only.

          <strong>Lesson(s) Learned:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="indented">
          <ol>
            <li> 
              I started to understand what Object-Oriented programming is.
              <br /><br />
              (When I applied for this job, I claimed to know OOP. But I later realized that I really did not know OOP. I only knew about what a class is, what an interface is, what an abstract class is, what polymorphism is, but I did not not yet have a full understanding about their purpose.)
              <br /><br />
              This is where I <em>started</em> to understand the Dependency Inversion Principle, the use of the Factory design pattern, and other things.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li> 
              I learned that programmers at this level of their carreer needs lots of guidance/mentoring from their seniors, most especially when the project is in a complex state already, and if the seniors don't want the juniors to mess with the code. :grin:
              <br /><br />
              (When I become a senior developer someday, I intend to guide/mentor my teammates who are in the beginning years of their carreer... provided of course that they also share some of their knowledge with me. :smile:)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li> 
              Also, I think it will be helpful to give from time-to-time some readings or lectures about the domain of the system being maintained by the programmers, so that it will not be very hard for them to understand the parts of the codebase where knowledge of the domain is needed.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              This is the time where I, and my teammates, plunged into the Clean Code book because one of our team leads made us read one chapter of the book each week, and spend about an hour each week discussing that chapter.
              <br /><br />
              Unfortunately, for some reasons unknown to me, our discussions stopped after a few meetings. We did not finish the book. We only discussed up to chapter five, if I remember it correctly. And I read up to chapter 8 only of the book. :disappointed:
              But I learned a lot from the chapters which I read.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              This is where I experienced writing unit tests <em>after-the-fact</em>, that is, after the production code is already written. — It was hard. :smile:
              <br /><br />
              There were parts of the system that were somewhat easy to test. But there were parts that were hard to test. Those parts that were hard to tests? — those that used <code>DateTime.Now</code>, and static methods, and extension methods of C# (which basically are still static methods), those parts that use (what I now know as) Service Locator — I skipped testing them :smiling_imp:. Of course I first tried to look for ways on how to test those things... 
              <!--
              I remember even trying to read "The Art of Unit Testing" to help myself with the task (I did not finish the book of course. I read only the first few chapters. :grin:)
               -->
              <br /><br />
              I think the time I spent writing those tests was a waste of time :grin:, partly because there were parts of the system that I skipped testing (because I did not know how to test them), and partly because I did not have the goal of using the tests to make the design of the system <em>better</em> at a later time, which is supposed to be the reason for writing tests for an existing software. (I did not yet know that books such as <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Working-Effectively-with-Legacy-Code-Michael-Feathers/9780131177055?a_aid=jflaga">"Working Effectively with Legacy Code"</a> existed.)
              <br /><br />
              Don't get me wrong here. I don't hate unit testing. During that time, I already have an appreciation on the benefits of having unit tests — it had been three years already since I first heard about unit testing and TDD during that time.
              <br /><br />
              I think I should have told my team leads about my opinion that writing those tests was just a waste of time. If I have told them about it, they might have explained to me why those tests should be written, and they might have helped me look for ways to write tests for the <em>untestables</em> that I encountered. But I was very timid during that time and was afraid to express my opinions.
              <br /><br />
              But despite that experience, I'm not against writing tests. I am even a <a href="/memorabilia/quotes/tdd/">TDD advocate</a> today through the influence of Uncle Bob Martin. But writing tests <em>after</em> the production code is already written requires a somewhat different skillset than doing TDD. I was, and is still, not skillfull on writing tests <em>after-the-fact</em>. But I'm trying to be good at it also.

  Of course I understand that the peak of an enlightenment comes from a series of little enlightenments. So even though this article of Uncle Bob is very special to me, I acknowledge that <strong>there are lots of <em>other</em> materials (and experiences) that helped me come into this kind of enlightenment</strong>.

  <!-- 
  <br /><br />

  Of course I'm not saying that this is the only thing that brought enlightenment to me, because... 
  as [...] said in  <http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-39/luthers-living-legacy.html>        
  rather it is kind of the turning point of my midset. I was very frameworks-oriented since I started learning about creating line-of-business applications. But this (along with other materials produced by Uncle Bob) made me understand that the frameworks and databases are not the center of our application.

          Nothing extraordinary. Just did the tasks assigned to me.
          <br /><br />
          But this time, because I already have a better understanding of polymorphism (and its use), the SOLID principles, and other things related to software design, I tried to use these  knowledge in my coding.
          <!-- 
          <br /><br />
          Also, when I learned that a new version of the app is to be made, I had this plan of separating the UI part from the other parts of the application. I was planning that, through this separation, I can eventually transfer all the business rules into another module. (I also heard from my teammates before that this kind of separation will also help in making the build time of the app to go down --- in the machine I was using, it takes about 4 minutes for the build to finish!)
          <br /><br />
          You see, the codebase I was working on has only one module because it was only a small project. This single module contains the <em>presentation layer</em> (we were using MVP), and <code>Helper</code> classes which basically contains <em>data logic</em> and some <em>business logic</em>. It also has <code>Model</code> classes which are data holders.
          <br /><br />
          While working on version two of the app, I saw that some of the data-access part leaked into the presentation layer. So when I heard that a new version of the app is to be made, I tried to do something to separate the <code>Helper</code> classes and <code>Model</code> classes into another module before the development of the next version starts. I was planning, through this separation, to slowly transfer the <em>business rules</em> into yet another module. And I was also hopeful that I can mold the app into a form where I can be able to do TDD in the <em>business rules</em> module when adding the new features for the new version of the app.
          <br /><br />
          But because I was not a master of the art of persuation, my plan was not pushed. :disappointed:
          <br /><br />
          Well, it did not matter that much to me because I knew that I was (and is still) not an expert on Android development, and there might be some issues that I know nothing about that might have made the separation bad for the future of the app.

              I learned how to work on a Java platform.
              <br /><br />
              Before this job, I only knew how to do real world apps using .NET.

              Doing Android made me more confident that I can also do work on other platforms.

              Even though we were using <a href="/2018/05/23/rxjava-is-not-intuitive/">RxJava</a> in our project, which others say makes dealing with background threads much easier, there was a time where I had to deal with what they call a <em>race condition</em> with this threads thing while working on version 2 of the app. 
              It was hard. The bug was intermittent. It was hard to find, partly because a large part of the project uses RxJava in a wrong way.
              <small>
                (After I few months working on the project I discovered that when using RxJava, methods must return <code>Observables</code> all the way up from the data source to the presentation layer, so that they can be composed.)
              </small>
              <br /><br />
              But I'm not 100% sure if the wrong way of using RxJava is truly the reason for that bug. Perhaps it was just my ignorance on how to deal with threads.
              Luckily, that feature was removed during the development of version 3 of the app. <em>Yehey!</em>
              <br /><br />
              I still have to learn more about this <em>threads</em> thing.

<h2 id="im-an-initiate">
  <strong>I'm an Initiate; perhaps a beginning Codesmith</strong>
</h2>

Using [Terence McGhee's "Software Ninja Class Hierarchy"](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html), <em>today</em>, I consider myself to be an [**Initiate**](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#initiate), because I _try_ to write code that is easy to read. I do that because I know that programmers spend more time reading code than writing code. 

I'm not saying that I _always_ write code that is easy to read. I still write messy code during _trying_ times or during _boring_ times or _lazy_ times, with the intention of cleaning them up _later_ of course :grin:. But I'm already aware, through experience, that code that is easy to read is valuable code. I also understand that _later_ means _never_ so if your organization insist that I should _never_ write messy code, I will be happy to comply. :smile:

Also, I heard some people say that programmers sometimes sell themselves short. In relation to that, you might still forgive me if I consider myself a [**Level "Zero" Codesmith**](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#codesmith) because I have little knowledge about TDD, the SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and some Design Patterns.  (Please note that in programming, _"zero"_ could mean _"initial"_ :grin:)

<!--
But Terence McGhee said that to be considered a codesmith one must already have the experience of "consistently applying these software-creation techniques _successfully_ in real software. So perhaps considering my own self as a Codesmith is just wishful thinking. :smile:
-->


<div class="message" markdown="1">
**Caution:** [I claimed to know OOP when I applied for my first and second jobs.](/2018/01/08/a-better-way-than-object-orientation-and-TDD/) I passed the interviews during those times, of course. But a few years later, I realized that [I barely knew what OOP is really all about](https://www.quora.com/How-much-is-Uncle-Bobs-definition-of-OOP-compatible-with-the-mainstream-definition). I came to this realization while listening to a talk of Uncle Bob Martin where he mentioned something about [programmers claiming to know OOP when they do not truly know OOP.](https://youtu.be/Nsjsiz2A9mg?t=34m5s) Ouch! I was that programmer. :laughing: 
<br /><br />
This kind of realization actually gives me doubt on whether I already truly understand what OO is today. But... all I can say is that today, I know that I have a _better_ understanding of what OO truly is.
<br /><br />
... So be cautious about me claiming to be an [**Initiate**](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#initiate) already. Perhaps I am still a [Chump Coder](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#chumpcoder), or an [Expanded Chump](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#expandedchump), in which case all I can say is, <em>"Teach me master..."</em> :smile:

<h2 id="learning-philosophy">
    <strong>My learning philosophy today on software development</strong>
</h2>

When I started coding, my focus on learning was trying to master the specifics of a programming language.

Then a few years later, my focus moved into trying to master specific frameworks and libraries.

But then I heard Uncle Bob Martin saying that software development has not changed in the last 40 years. And I heard Mattias Petter Johansson's [advise for programmers:](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)

> "... **learn the stuff that doesn’t change around a lot**. Learn the fundamentals that we figured out in the 70s and that have been true since. Learn programming in **general**. Don’t be a better Angular programmer, or even a better JavaScript programmer — just be a better programmer, period."

So today, my focus moved into learning the basic principles of software design and methodologies, because these are the things that do not change a lot, and these things will help me make software that is [highly maintainable](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2016/10/15/551B3828CD47198C7C5A58903228DA71.html), which many master programmers say is the primary value of software for customers (and for the programmers also).

<!-- 
Many years ago, I heard/read someone say that the maintenance phase is the most expensive phase of a software system.
 -->

Today, my learning philosophy is like this:

> [Just-in-time learning](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2014/06/23/dont-overwhelm-trying-learn-much/) about specific languages and frameworks and libraries

> Ahead-of-time learning about basic principles and practices in software development, and about [programming in general](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)

For example, there was a time when I was trying to learn AngularJS (version 1) because it was the frontend technology that is being used in my new job _(just-in-time learning of specific frameworks)_. Then on the side, I was consuming ["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Refactoring-Martin-Fowler/9780201485677?a_aid=jflaga) of Martin Fowler _(ahead-of-time learning of general concepts.)_

<!--
For example, these days, July 2018, I am learning/reviewing AngularJS because it is the frontend technology that is being used in my job _(just-in-time learning of specific frameworks)_. Then on the side, I am consuming ["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Refactoring-Martin-Fowler/9780201485677?a_aid=jflaga) of Martin Fowler and the reading materials of ["6.005 — Software Construction on MIT OpenCourseWare"](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa18/) _(ahead-of-time learning of general concepts)_
-->

I hope that kind of learning philosophy is okay with you. :smile:

<!--
**When I am already hired in your company**, I will spend the first few weeks concentrating on learning about the structure/architecture of the project I will be involved in, learning about the coding standards being used by the team, learning about the specific frameworks and libraries and languages that are being used in the project (if I am not yet familiar with them), and most importantly learning about the domain of the business that the software is being built for, even to the point of learning _why_ the software was built.

When I reach the point where am already comfortable with my knowledge on the specific frameworks and libraries being used in the project, I will move my concentration again into [learning about programming _in general_.](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)
-->

<!-- 
If I am hired at your company, my plan would be something like this.

1. I will ask about the specific frameworks or libraries that are being used in the project I will be involved in, and spend a few days or weeks familiarizing myself with them.


If I will be having a lead developer, perhaps he already has a plan on how to make me get familiar with the project I will be involved in.

If not, I have my own method of getting familiar with the project. I will spend a few days getting familiar with the frameworks and libraries that are bing used....

<h2 id="more-lessons-learned">
  <strong>More Lessons Learned</strong>
</h2>

Here are other lessons I learned while working as a software developer.

<dl>

  <br />
  <dt>We should take care of our codebase</dt>
  <dd>
    Even if the codebase started out to be clean, it will get messy if the team working on it is not regularly checking on the code when new features are being added or when bugs are being fixed. 
    <br /><br />
    I believe that code review (or pair programming) and proper guidance/mentoring from seniors or from those who are already familiar with the system, even if they are not yet seniors, can help solve this problem.
    <br /><br />
    I think no one wants to stay working on a messy codebase for too long. <a href="/resume/2019/anti-resume/#if-your-codebase-is-messy">I don't want to work on a messy codebase for too long</a> , but I can bear working on it for a long time if the team working on that codebase decides clean it up little by little everyday.    
    <br /><br />    
  </dd>

  <br />
  <dt>Writing unit tests <em>after</em> the production code is already written is hard</dt>
  <dd>
<!--   
    <blockquote>
      "Automated unit testing is a gateway drug to Test-Driven Development" - 
      <a href="http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/automated-unit-testing-x-ray-vision-for-code-quality/">Eddie Bush</a>
    </blockquote>
 -->
    Through Uncle Bob's 
    <a href="/2017/05/11/expecting-professionalism-by-uncle-bob-martin/#advantages-of-tdd">charismatic presentation of TDD</a> 
    in his talks, I understood the value of TDD.
    <br /><br />
    So even though I had a <em>somewhat</em> bad experience with writing automated tests, as I stated in the "Lesson(s) Learned" section in my 
    <a href="#work-experience-2">second job</a>
    , I am not against writing automated tests. I am for it, most especially when they are written <em>first</em> and not last.
    <br /><br />
    But if an <em>existing</em> codebase has no tests, and we want to write tests for it, I think we must first consider the pros and cons before continuing on that kind of endeavor. :smile:
  </dd>

  <br />
  <dt>There must be some kind of a system for asking help</dt>
  <dd>
    Sometimes programmers get stuck with a problem that is not googleable (or sometimes they do not know what to google for), but are afraid to ask for help for some reasons only known to them. (My reason for being afraid to ask for help is because the person I will ask help from might be busy. Sometimes, I do not know who the right person to the ask. Sometimes, I'm afraid people might think I'm stupid :smile: )
    <br /><br />
    I think doing pair programming from time to time can help make this awkwardness of asking questions go away.
    <br /><br />
    But perhaps you know of other ways to solve this problem...
  </dd>
  
  <br />
  <dt><em>More next time...</em></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>


<!--
  <br />
  <dt>Any member of the team must be allowed to speak up</dt>
  <dd>
    <blockquote>
      "When people have a choice of two different places to put things, and one is faster and easier, a lot of people are going to go for the easy one."
      <br />
       — Eddie Bush (from <a href="http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/automated-unit-testing-x-ray-vision-for-code-quality/">Automated Unit Testing: X-Ray Vision for Code Quality"</a>)
    </blockquote>
    <br />
    Sometimes a member of a team finds something wrong in the codebase of the application he is involved in, and this wrong it is being propagated throughout the codebase (This happens sometimes perhaps because copy-pasting bad code is easier to do than writing good code from scratch). It would be great if a team will let any member speak up if he sees something wrong in the codebase, and that the team must do something to either convince everybody that it is not wrong or to fix the wrong.
    <br /><br />
    (Note: <a href="/memorabilia/books/the-craftsman-series/#4">It's okay for me to be told that my code is wrong.</a> If I think that it is <em>not</em> wrong, I will try to reason with you to convince you that it is not wrong. But please <a href="/2017/04/20/argue-to-learn-not-to-win">argue with me</a> if you think that it is really realy wrong, or give me a better way of doing it. :smile:)
  </dd>

  <br />
  <dt>The business rules must be separated</dt>
  <dd>
    My momentary exposure to DDD and Clean Architecture made me realize that the business rules (or domain logic) is the most important part of a software system, even more important than the frameworks and libraries that we, programmers, love.
    <br /><br />
    Because of that, I learned that in a software system, there must be a <a href="http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/policy-mechanism-preservation-business-value/">very clear separation of the business rules from the other parts of the system</a>. This will make it easier for new developers on the team to understand the domain the system is being built for, and easier when fixing bugs.
    <br /><br />
    It doesn't matter how old or new the frameworks or libraries the team is currently using. If the business rules are not separated from the other parts of the system, time will come where it will be very hard for the developers to add new functionalities to the system and to fix bugs.
    <br /><br />
    Of course that does not mean that I'm already an expert on this <em>business rules separation</em> thing, but a team who has this kind of goal is a very good team, I believe. And I would love to be a part of that kind of team. :smile:

  <dt>I need to become proactive</dt>
  <dd>
    You might have noticed that in the "Contributions" parts of my Work Experiences, I only put <em>"just did the tasks assigned to me"</em> in there. I was kind of passive during my past jobs. I think it's because I am introverted and I lack experience during that time, and so I was not very confident in making suggestions. (I was not necessarily 100% passive because I recently found in my notes in my second job some unspoken suggestions on how we might make work better.)
    <br /><br />
    I want to change that. I want to do great work! And to be able to do great work I need to become proactive, I think. I'm not yet very sure how to do that but I can find ways.
    <br /><br />
    I hope that being proactive is not restricted in your company. :smile:

  <dt>The members of a team must have a common set of values</dt>
  <dd>
    Before committing into a job, I think it's best if one knows about the standards or values of the team he be working with. If the team's values and his values match, then that would be a good job for him.
    <br /><br />
    I would like to be part of a team who intends to make their codebase as clean as they can make it. I do not have a skill on leadership so I'm not good at influencing others to have the same values as I have. So for now, I have to make sure that the team I will be working with already have the same values that I do (revise)

 - When I am already working on a project, is it okay to ask "any" questions about the project to any team member? Can I ask anytime? Or there are specific times of the day when I can disturb them to ask questions. (Or each team member is different and I have to ask each one of them how and when they are to be approached when I have a question.)

 - Do you expect me (and my teammates) to clean up messy code if we find messy code in the codebase? Or you prefer that we do not touch

## I am for hire as a "Business Rules Guardian"

With my current skillset, this is the best that I can give you: being a to _help_ guide each member of a team to separate the business rules from the other parts of the system. (Please note that I used the word _help_, because with this kind of task I will be needing the cooperation of each member of the team I will be involved in.)


It doesn't matter what frameworks/libraries you use, I can learn how to use them in a month

I prefer to be involved in a new system that will be developed from scratch.

1. You can hire me to become part of the team that will start a project from scratch. I will make sure that the business rules is separated from the other parts of the system. If I am not yet familiar with the language(s), frameworks/libraries that your team will use, I can spend about a month studying those things.


2. Help your team separate the business rules from the other parts of an software system.


3. Help in the maintenance mode of a well designed system.

<h2 id="preferences">
    <strong style="color: #6a9fb5">Some preferences with future work:</strong>
</h2>

NOTE: These are only _preferences_. I'm not trying to give mandates to the kind of work you should be giving me. :smile:

1. I would like to be involved in new projects that will be written from scratch, where I can have influence on the decisions that will be made (or at least I am in a position where I know the reasons behind the decisions being made).
<br /><br />
I would just like to add that if I will be involved in developing a new software from scratch, I would highly recommend using the [Clean Architecture model](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) of Uncle Bob Martin (or something similar to it), and use TDD also; because, as you might have already known, it is hard to create software that is _easy to change_. Many software developers believe that this Clean Architecture model and TDD can greatly help in making software easy to change.
<br /><br />
... also, our clients (and the programmers involved in the software project) will greatly benefit if we do something to make software easy to change.

2. And, if possible, I would also like to be mentored by someone who have much experience in the software development industry.

3. I'm also interested in mentoring beginning programmers because, as what Uncle Bob Martin points out [in one of his talks](https://youtu.be/BSaAMQVq01E?t=4277), "We're in a state of perpetual inexperience" because half of the programmers in the world have less than five years of experience.

<br />
> "The mentor doesn't necessarily need to be a master of software development. In
fact, there are advantages to having a mentor who is closer in proximity to the
apprentice's level of experience."

4. If I will be working on an existing project, I might be needing lots of help in understanding the structure of the project in the first few weeks... most expecially when I am involved in a project where I am not yet familiar with the frameworks or libraries that are being used. 
<br /><br />
But if I will be involved in new projects... I believe that I can _help_ with the architecture of _new_ projects, even when I am not yet familiar with the specific frameworks and libraries that will be used in that project --- I can learn about the frameworks and libraries _inline_, I mean, during my vacant times. :smile:

Thank you! :smile:

I think I am enjoying more when I am involved design part of creating software systems --- by _design_ I mean the design or architecture of the software and not the UI part.

And because I concentrate on the _design_ part of the system, I think I can still be able to work on **new** projects even when I am not yet very familiar with the specific frameworks or libraries those projects, as long as my teammates are already familiar with the frameworks or libraries that we will be using.

I am kind of one who wants to help keep software from rotting --- and I would like to emphasize the word **_help_** because I can't do it on my own, most especially when I am not yet familiar with the technologies that will be used in the project.

I think I will also enjoy mentoring junior software developers.

I think I will be excited with work most when I am involved deciding about the architecture of new software system, or when I am involved in an existing software that has a good architecture, or when I am involved in a project whose team practices TDD.



I would also like to know what my responsibilities will be when I get hired.
