### I'm an [Initiate](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#initiate); perhaps a beginner [Codesmith](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#codesmith)

Using [Terence McGhee's "Software Ninja Class Hierarchy"](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html), <em>today</em>, I consider myself to be an [Initiate](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#initiate), because I _try_ to write code that is easy to read. I do that because I know that programmers spend more time reading code than writing code. 

I'm not saying that I _always_ write code that is easy to read. I still write messy code during _trying_ times, or during _boring_ times, or during _lazy_ times --- most especially when I'm working on a legacy code base where trying to write clean code is much harder to do than when writing code from scratch --- but that comes with the intention of cleaning them up _later_ of course :grin:. But I'm already aware, through experience, that code that is easy to read is valuable code. I also understand that _later_ means _never_, so if your organization insists that I should _never_ write messy code, I will be happy to comply. It might take more time, of course.

Also, I heard some people say that programmers sometimes sell themselves short. So you might still forgive me if I consider myself a [Level "Zero" Codesmith](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#codesmith) because I have little knowledge about TDD, the SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and some Design Patterns.  

<!-- (Please note that in programming, _"zero"_ could mean _"initial"_) -->


But Terence McGhee said that to be considered a codesmith one must already have the experience of [_"consistently applying these software-creation techniques successfully in real software."_](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#codesmith) So perhaps seeing my own self as a Codesmith is just wishful thinking...

**Caution:** [I claimed to know OOP when I applied for my first and second jobs.](/2018/01/08/a-better-way-than-object-orientation-and-TDD/) I passed the interviews during those times, of course. But a few years later, I realized that [I barely knew what OOP is really all about](https://www.quora.com/How-much-is-Uncle-Bobs-definition-of-OOP-compatible-with-the-mainstream-definition). I came to this realization while listening to a talk of Uncle Bob Martin where he mentioned something about [programmers claiming to know OOP when they do not truly know OOP.](https://youtu.be/Nsjsiz2A9mg?t=34m5s) Ouch! I was that programmer. :laughing: 

This kind of realization actually gives me doubt on whether I already truly understand what OO is today. But... all I can say is that today, I know that I have a _better_ understanding of what OO truly is.

... So be cautious about me claiming to be an [Initiate](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#initiate) already. Perhaps I am still a [Chump Coder](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#chumpcoder), or an [Expanded Chump](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#expandedchump), in which case all I can say is, <em>"Teach me master..."</em>
