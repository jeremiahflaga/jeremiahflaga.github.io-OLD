## I'm not very good with UI (and UX)

... but I managed to work on UIs in all of my previous jobs, so I believe I can still manage to work with UIs when I work with you.

<!-- 
If I will be working with a UI/UX designer, I believe that he will not be having a problem working with me because I _intend_ to decouple my code from the UI (if possible*), so that my code will _not_ be very affected by UI changes, and the UI will not be very affected by my code changes.

(*Please understand that if a codebase is a legacy codebase, and is messy, it might take time before the _coupling_ problem can be fixed --- if you want it to be fixed and if it is not beyond my capability to fix it.)
