<h2 class="mb-5">My learning philosophy today on software development</h2>

When I started coding, my focus on learning was trying to master the specifics of a programming language.

Then a few years later, my focus moved into trying to master specific frameworks and libraries.

But then I heard Uncle Bob Martin saying that software development has not changed in the last 40 years. And I heard Mattias Petter Johansson's [advise for programmers:](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)

> "... **learn the stuff that doesn’t change around a lot**. Learn the fundamentals that we figured out in the 70s and that have been true since. Learn programming in **general**. Don’t be a better Angular programmer, or even a better JavaScript programmer — just be a better programmer, period."

So today, my focus moved into learning the basic principles of software design and methodologies, because these are the things that do not change a lot, and these things will help me make software that is [highly maintainable](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2016/10/15/551B3828CD47198C7C5A58903228DA71.html), which many master programmers say is the primary value of software for customers (and for the programmers also).

<!-- 
Many years ago, I heard/read someone say that the maintenance phase is the most expensive phase of a software system.
 -->

Today, my learning philosophy is like this:

> [Just-in-time learning](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2014/06/23/dont-overwhelm-trying-learn-much/) about specific languages and frameworks and libraries

> Ahead-of-time learning about basic principles and practices in software development, and about [programming in general](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)

For example, there was a time when I was trying to learn AngularJS (version 1) because it was the frontend technology that is being used in my new job _(just-in-time learning of specific frameworks)_. Then on the side, I was consuming ["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Refactoring-Martin-Fowler/9780201485677?a_aid=jflaga) of Martin Fowler _(ahead-of-time learning of general concepts.)_

For example, these days, July 2018, I am learning/reviewing AngularJS because it is the frontend technology that is being used in my job _(just-in-time learning of specific frameworks)_. Then on the side, I am consuming ["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Refactoring-Martin-Fowler/9780201485677?a_aid=jflaga) of Martin Fowler and the reading materials of ["6.005 — Software Construction on MIT OpenCourseWare"](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa18/) _(ahead-of-time learning of general concepts)_

I hope that kind of learning philosophy is okay with you. :blush:

<!--
**When I am already hired in your company**, I will spend the first few weeks concentrating on learning about the structure/architecture of the project I will be involved in, learning about the coding standards being used by the team, learning about the specific frameworks and libraries and languages that are being used in the project (if I am not yet familiar with them), and most importantly learning about the domain of the business that the software is being built for, even to the point of learning _why_ the software was built.

When I reach the point where am already comfortable with my knowledge on the specific frameworks and libraries being used in the project, I will move my concentration again into [learning about programming _in general_.](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)
