That quote from Uncle Bob seems to suggest that I can manage to work on any [LOB](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dragoman/2007/07/19/what-is-a-lob-application/) codebase, even those that use technologies I am not yet familiar with!!! 
Not very sure yet...

But if you cannot find anyone to work with your codebase, and if I also cannot find any job which uses technologies I am familiar with, I believe I can manage to work with your codebase. :blush: (Except when your codebase uses a functional language, I cannot work on it yet, because I have almost no knowledge about functional programming, at least for now.)
