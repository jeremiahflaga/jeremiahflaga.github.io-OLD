That quote from Uncle Bob seems to suggest that I can manage to work on any codebase, even those that use technologies I am not yet familiar with!!! 
Not very sure yet...

But if you cannot find anyone to work on your codebase, and if I also cannot find any job which uses technologies I am familiar with, I believe I can manage to work on your codebase. :blush: (Except when your codebase uses a functional language, I cannot work on it yet, because I have almost no knowledge about functional programming for now.)
