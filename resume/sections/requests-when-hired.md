Depending on the complexity of your software system, and depending on my familiarity with the technologies being used in your software system, I might ask to have pair programming sessions with one of your programmers, for 1-3 hours per day, during my first few weeks on the job. And maybe once every two weeks after that, _if still needed_. This will help me become familiar with the coding styles and standards of your programming team. This will also help in passing your team's values on to me.

However, all my own experience convinces me, and I have tried to show, that **the conceptual integrity of a system determines its ease of use. Good features and ideas that do not integrate with a system's basic concepts are best left out.** If there appear many such important but incompatible ideas, one scraps the whole system and starts again on an integrated system with different basic concepts.

If the architecture of the system I'll be working on is obvious on first look, and if it was already decided by the team to keep following that architecture, then no request coming from me on this.

If the architecture of the system I'll be working on is not obvious on first look, I would like to request for the team lead of software development to explain his architectural vision for the system. This will help me see where the project is going, and to have good knowledge on how I should write my code as to not deviate too much from his architectural ideas.

(I would like to note that when I use the words "team lead", what's in my mind is someone who is also working on the project hands-on, because in that case the team lead truly knows the system and its problems, and so it will be hard to argue against his architectural vision.)

If the system does not have an architecture (it's a mess) and no architectural vision is in place, then I would suggest that someone or sometwo be assigned to look for an architectural vision that will be followed from a set time in the future and forwards. If I am choosen as one of those who will set an architectural vision for the project, I would like to ask that it be made clear to the team why a single architectural idea is needed to make the system easier to manage or maintain, so that they will not rebel against me :smile:. (Depending on the complexity and size of your system, it might take a few months of working on the system before I can find an architectural vision which matches with the current state of the system --- that is, an architecture that will not require a big overhaul of the system, but still makes the system maintainable in the future.)
