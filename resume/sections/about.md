</p>

- About {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2013 | minus:1}} years of experience in C# & .NET Framework (this includes some experience of using JavaScript/TypeScript for the frontend side)
- More than one year of experience in mobile application development using Java & Android Platform
- Some experience in refactoring code and writing tests

What can I contribute to your project:

- Fix bugs.
- Add new features.
- Refactor and clean up codebase little-by-little as I work on it daily, if needed.
- Write tests, if needed <!-- ,and if I know of a way to make your software system testable if it is not yet testable.-->
<!-- - If there is a need, I think I can teach younger developers the concepts of clean coding and clean architecture while working on your software, perhaps through pair programming, or through code reviews.  -->

Anti-résumé:

- English is not my native language. So for me, writing in English is easier than conversing using it. Because when writing, I have lots of time to think on what to write. When conversing using English I need to respond quickly and there is very little time to think. :grin:

<!-- 
- Not very good with UIs (and UX), but I managed to work on UIs in all of my previous jobs, so I believe I can still manage to work with UIs when I work with you.
