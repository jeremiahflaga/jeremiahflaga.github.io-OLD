> For a long time it’s puzzled me that most books on software development processes talk about what to do when you are starting from a blank sheet of editor screen. It’s puzzled me because that’s not the most common situation that people write code in. Most people have to make changes to an existing code base, even if it’s their own. In an ideal world this code base is well designed and well factored, but we all know how often the ideal world appears in our career.

<p class="lead">I'm a software developer,
<!-- <a href="#lob-apps-footnote" id="lob-apps-footnote-indicator">*</a> -->
with over eight years of experience, including:</p>

- About seven years of experience in C# & .NET Framework (this includes some experience of using JavaScript/TypeScript for the frontend side)
- More than one year of experience in mobile application development using Java & Android Platform
<!-- - A few months of experience on Angular -->
- Some experience in refactoring code and writing tests

<p class="lead">What can I contribute to your project?</p>

- Fix bugs
- Add new features 
- Write tests (if needed, and if I know how to do it in a specific software system)
- Refactor and clean up codebase ([if needed](/2020/07/31/some-legacy-code-lessons-and-resources/)), [little-by-little as I work on it daily](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/software-design-is-human-relationships-part-2-of-3-waiters-changers-and-sufficiency-4c0bb9a08d23), 
- If there is a need, I think I can teach younger developers the concepts of Clean Architecture and clean coding, through pair programming perhaps.

<div class="alert alert-primary small" markdown="1">

NOTE: Depending on the complexity of your software system, I might ask to have pair programming sessions with one of your programmers for 1-3 hours per day during my first two or four weeks on the job. This will help me become familiar with the coding styles and standards of your programming team. This will also help in passing your team's values on to me.


> Many consultants believe that pair programming is the universal solution to any problem that a software project can have.
> 
> - It spreads the technical skills
> - It spreads the functional knowledge
> - It builds the team
> - It's fun

<!-- Not sure if there are programmers who make a codebase they are working on harder to maintain on purpose. If there are, I am not that kind of programmer.  -->

, because you know, ["If it ain't broke, don't fix it"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_it_ain%27t_broke,_don%27t_fix_it), but of course, also, ["what does broke mean?"](link to WELC))

<!-- 

- I can teach younger developers Clean Architecture and clean coding. (I think I have a good grasp of Clean Architecture (or Port  Adapters, etc.), clean coding (writing intention-revealing code)
- - You might already have an employee or employees who have good grast on these, but you have not identified them yet. I can help identify them for you.

 - Writing code is about expressing your intentions more than just writing code that does the job.
