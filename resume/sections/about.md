    I'm a software developer,
    with about {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2013 }} years of experience, including:
</p>

- About {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2013 | minus:1}} years of experience in C# & .NET Framework (this includes some experience of using JavaScript/TypeScript for the frontend side)
- More than one year of experience in mobile application development using Java & Android Platform
- Some experience in refactoring code and writing tests

<p class="lead">What can I contribute to your project?</p>

- Fix bugs.
- Add new features.
- Refactor and clean up codebase [little-by-little as I work on it daily](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/software-design-is-human-relationships-part-2-of-3-waiters-changers-and-sufficiency-4c0bb9a08d23) ([if needed](/2020/07/31/some-legacy-code-lessons-and-resources/)).
- Write tests, if needed
- If there is a need, _I think_ I can teach younger developers the concepts of clean coding and clean architecture while working on your software, perhaps through pair programming, or through code reviews.

- During my first six to seven years as a programmer, I mainly used _written_ English when communicating with clients. For that reason, my _spoken_ English is not yet very good. I'm still working on improving it. But I can understand English, even complex sentence constructions. I'm just not yet very confident when using it in spoken conversations.
