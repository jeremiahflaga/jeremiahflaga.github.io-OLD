                  Before this time, I thought architecture is about how to combine all these frameworks together to form an application!

                  ... did I place <em>much</em> of my time and attention in the wrong places!?... I'm not sure. Perhaps this is just part of growing up as a programmer through trial-and-error, with no one <em>personally</em> guiding you. :grin:

                  Of course I understand that the peak of an enlightenment comes from a series of little enlightenments. So even though this article of Uncle Bob is very special to me, I acknowledge that there are lots of <em>other</em> materials (and experiences) that helped me come into this kind of enlightenment.

                  I have always been in search for the best way to structure software systems. Now I think I already know the gist of it:
