    <p></p>
    I read and studied Uncle Bob Martin's blog post titled <a  href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">"A Little Architecture"</a>.
    <br /><br />
    <em><strong>I would say that this is the time of my enlightenment on how to structure software projects.</strong></em>
    <br /><br />
    <blockquote>
    <p>
    "Architecture is <strong>not</strong> about frameworks and databases and web servers..."
    </p>
    <p>
    "The important decisions that a Software Architect makes are the ones that allow you to <strong>NOT</strong> make the decisions about the database, and the webserver, and the frameworks."
    </p>
    <p>
    â€” Uncle Bob Martin

    Of course I understand that the peak of an enlightenment comes from a series of little enlightenments. So even though this article of Uncle Bob is very special to me, I acknowledge that <strong>there are lots of <em>other</em> materials (and experiences) that helped me come into this kind of enlightenment</strong>.
