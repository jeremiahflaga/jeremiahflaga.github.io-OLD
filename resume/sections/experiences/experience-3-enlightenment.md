      I read and studied Uncle Bob Martin's blog post titled <a  href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html">"A Little Architecture"</a>.

      <em><strong>I would say that this is the time of my enlightenment on how to structure software projects.</strong></em>

                  Before this time, I thought architecture is about how to combine all these frameworks together to form an application!

                  Of course I understand that the peak of an enlightenment comes from a series of little enlightenments. So even though this article of Uncle Bob is very special to me, I acknowledge that <strong>there are lots of <em>other</em> materials (and experiences) that helped me come into this kind of enlightenment</strong>.

                  I have always been in search for the best way to structure software systems. Now I think I already know the gist of it:

                  just do your best to separate the business rules from the other parts of the software system.
