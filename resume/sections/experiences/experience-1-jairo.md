                        This is where I was first exposed to this idea of DDD. Our employer made us read some articles about DDD because we will be using it in an in-house project. But I was not lucky to be involved in the in-house project because the employment of three junior developers, which inlcuded me, ended after six months due to a problem unbeknownst to me.

                        I just saw the initial structure of the project. I saw that there was a <code>Core</code> module, which I now understand to be the module which holds the business rules. There was also an <code>Infrastructure</code> module(s), which holds the data layer, the email service, and some other parts of the system. There was no presentation layer yet during the time that I saw the project. But it has unit tests.
