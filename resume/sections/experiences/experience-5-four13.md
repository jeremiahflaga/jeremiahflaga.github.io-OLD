                        The first app I worked on has two ways for data access: one uses a database-first model of Entity Framework and the other one uses a code-first model of Entity Framework. It sometimes get's in the way when I'm searching for the model to use. So I refactored the app so that it will only use the code-first model. Then I was able to remove all of the the database-first models when the refactorings was finished.

                        But it was just a small app and not very complex, so it was doable within a short period of time.

                        I was the only one working on my first project so it seems to me that I am free to do whatever I want. There was a test module in the project, but it was empty. So I decided to find a way so that I can create tests for the tasks assigned to me. This means I will need to re-structure things...

                        I was able to setup the tests, but I later abandoned them for some reasons that I cannot remember anymore. (I think part of the reason was the client was billed for )
                        <br />
                        But now the project has two sturctures...

                            "I will certainly not contend that only the architects will have good architectural ideas. Often the fresh concept does come from an implementer or from a user. However, all my own experience convinces me, and I have tried to show, that the conceptual integrity of a system determines its ease of use. Good features and ideas that do not integrate with a system's basic concepts are best left out. If there appear many such important but incompatible ideas, one scraps the whole system and starts again on an integrated system with different basic concepts." &mdash; Frederick P. Brooks (from "The Mythical Man-Month")

                        I think the lesson to be learned here is that if the structure of a software project is too messy and we decided to restructure it, we must choose a structure that is not too different from the old one, because such restructuring cannot be done in a day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Changing it to a completely different structure is okay only if the original restructur-er will be involved in the project for a long time.
