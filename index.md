Hi, I'm Jeremiah Flaga, also known as _Jboy_. I am software developer and loves programming! 

I also like writing about stuffs that I learned recently, and about some thoughts that cross my mind.

Most of the things I write will not be interesting to you... so, instead of pointing you directly to my blog, I'm going to link from here _**a few blog posts that might interest you.**_ :smile:
