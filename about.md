I'm Jeremiah Flaga, also known as Jboy Flaga.

I am software developer and loves programming.

<!--

<small>_I also love music and is able to play simple piano (I'm not an expert on the piano :smile: )_</small>

-->

I would someday like to be involved in software projects whose team members likes to practice TDD and who agrees with Uncle Bob Martin on his [_expectations on programmers_](/2017/05/13/expecting-professionalism-by-uncle-bob-martin/).

 If you have a greenfield software project and needs a team member who thinks (_or wants to think_) like that, please [contact me](mailto:flaga.jeremiah@gmail.com).
